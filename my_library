It plays a key role in the export, distribution, and sequestration of carbon in the oceanic water column, posited to be a source of atmospheric climate regulation. Biogeochemistry of Marine Dissolved Organic Matter, Second Edition, focuses on the chemical constituents of DOM and its biogeochemical, biological, and ecological significance in the global ocean, and provides a single, unique source for the references, information, and informed judgments of the community of marine biogeochemists. Presented by some of the world's leading scientists, this revised edition reports on the major advances in this area and includes new chapters covering the role of DOM in ancient ocean carbon cycles, the long term stability of marine DOM, the biophysical dynamics of DOM, fluvial DOM qualities and fate, and the Mediterranean Sea. Biogeochemistry of Marine Dissolved Organic Matter, Second Edition, is an extremely useful resource that helps people interested in the largest pool of active carbon on the planet (DOC) get a firm grounding on the general paradigms and many of the relevant references on this topic"--},

Currently, components of the Arctic cryosphere are subjected to dramatic change due to global warming. The need to document, understand, project, and respond to changes in the cryosphere and their consequences stimulated a comprehensive international assessment called ‚ÄúSWIPA‚Äù: Snow, Water, Ice, Permafrost in the Arctic. Some of the extensive key SWIPA chapters have been summarized and made more widely available to a global audience with multi-disciplinary interests in this Special Report of Ambio. In this article, an overview is provided of this Special Report in the context of the more detailed and wider scope of the SWIPA Report. Accelerated changes in major components of the Arctic cryosphere are documented. Evidence of feedback mechanisms between the cryosphere and other parts of the climate system are identified as contributing factors to enhanced Arctic warming while the growing importance of Arctic land-based ice as a contributor to global sealevel rise is quantified. Cryospheric changes will result in multifaceted and cascading effects for people within and beyond the Arctic presenting both challenges and opportunities.},

On the bases of our data and a compilation of literature data the global oceanic emissions of methane were reassessed by introducing a concept of regional gas transfer coefficients. Our estimates computed with two different air-sea exchange models lie in the range of 11‚Äì18 Tg CH4 yr‚àí1. Despite the fact that shelf areas and estuaries only represent a small part of the world's ocean they contribute about 75\% to the global oceanic emissions. We applied a simple, coupled, three-layer model to evaluate the time dependent variation of the oceanic flux to the atmosphere. The model calculations indicate that even with increasing tropospheric methane concentration, the ocean will remain a source of atmospheric methane.},

Hydrocarbon seeps are known to support local benthic productivity, but little is known about their impact on photosynthetic organisms in the overlying water column. Here we present observations with high temporal and spatial resolution of chlorophyll concentrations in the northern Gulf of Mexico using in situ and shipboard flow-through fluorescence measurements from May to July 2012, as well as an analysis of ocean-colour satellite images from 1997 to 2007. All three methods reveal elevated chlorophyll concentrations in waters influenced by natural hydrocarbon seeps. Temperature and nutrient profiles above seep sites suggest that nutrient-rich water upwells from depth, which may facilitate phytoplankton growth and thus support the higher chlorophyll concentrations observed. Because upwelling occurs at natural seep locations around the world, we conclude that offshore hydrocarbon seeps, and perhaps other types of deep ocean vents and seeps at depths exceeding 1,000 m, may influence biogeochemistry and productivity of the overlying water column.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic warming of the oceans can release methane (CH4) currently stored in sediments as gas hydrates. This CH4 will be oxidized to CO2, thus increasing the acidification of the oceans. We employ a biogeochemical model of the multimillennial carbon cycle to determine the evolution of the oceanic dissolved carbonate system over the next 13‚Äâkyr in response to CO2 from gas hydrates, combined with a reasonable scenario for long-term anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Hydrate-derived CO2 will appreciably delay the neutralization of ocean acidity and the return to preindustrial-like conditions. This finding is the same with CH4 release and oxidation in either the deep ocean or the atmosphere. A change in CaCO3 export, coupled to CH4 release, would intensify the transient rise of the carbonate compensation depth, without producing any changes to the long-term evolution of the carbonate system. Overall, gas hydrate destabilization implies a moderate additional perturbation to the carbonate system of the Anthropocene oceans.},

	abstract = {Oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM) is one of the largest pools of reduced carbon on Earth, yet DOM remains poorly chemically characterized. Studies to determine the chemical nature of oceanic DOM have been impeded by the lack of efficient and non-fractioning methods to recover oceanic DOM. Here, a DOM fraction ({\textasciitilde} 40 to 86\% recovery) was isolated using reverse osmosis/electrodialysis (RO/ED) and analyzed by solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Samples were obtained from biogeochemically distinct environments: photobleached surface gyre, productive coastal upwelling zone, oxygen minimum, North Atlantic Deep Water, and North Pacific Deep Water. A ubiquitous ‚Äòbackground‚Äô refractory carbon pool was apparent throughout the ocean and dominated in the deep Pacific Ocean. Advanced NMR spectral editing revealed that condensed aromatic and quaternary anomeric carbons contribute to this deep refractory DOC pool, the quaternary anomeric carbons being a newly identified and potentially important component of bio-refractory carbohydrate-like carbon. Additionally, our results support the multi-pool (e.g. 3-pool: labile, semi-labile, and refractory) conceptual model of marine DOM biogeochemistry. Surface samples, hypothesized to be enriched in labile and semi-labile DOM, were enriched in carbohydrate-like material consistent with prior studies. High carboxyl signals in the deep Pacific support the hypothesis that a major fraction of the refractory pool consists of carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM).},

	abstract = {Coastal oceans link terrestrial and marine carbon cycles. Yet, carbon sources and sinks in these biomes remain poorly understood. Here, we explore the dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along the Amazon River-to-ocean continuum from the lower mainstem at √ìbidos to the open ocean of the western tropical North Atlantic. We molecularly characterized DOM via ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), determined DOM stable carbon isotopes, and interpreted the data in the context of bacterial abundance and production, phytoplankton biomass and composition. Multivariate analysis revealed that the DOM molecular variability in the plume was mainly influenced by the input of terrigenous DOM. Incubation experiments with water from close to the river mouth showed that photo- and bio-degradation preferentially removed 13C-depleted and 13C-enriched terrigenous DOM, respectively. However, there was no significant quantitative change in the total amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over five days. This result suggests that most of the reactive DOM had already been bio-degraded upstream within the river and that photo-degradation was diminished in the turbid plume close to the river mouth. Terrigenous DOM therefore appeared to be relatively non-reactive nearshore. In the less turbid offshore plume, enhanced light penetration stimulated growth of phytoplankton and increased bacterial production. Although marine DOM compounds became relatively enriched, bulk DOC concentrations were 9 to 30\% below levels expected from conservative mixing of river and ocean endmembers suggesting that quantitative removal of terrigenous DOM was not compensated by marine DOM production. We propose that removal of terrigenous DOM in the outer plume may be enhanced by (i) bio-degradation primed by reactive algal DOM, (ii) photo-degradation, which may further break down DOM into more bio-available forms, and possibly (iii) sorption of DOM to sinking particles.},

	abstract = {In Hawai ªi and other Pacific high islands submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) can be a significant and continuous source of solutes to nearshore reefs and may play a key role in the structure and function of benthic coral and algal communities. Identifying SGD sources and linking them to reef biogeochemistry is technically challenging. Here we analyzed spectra of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) in coral reefs in the context of a suite of biogeochemical parameters along gradients of SGD to characterize fDOM composition and evaluate the utility of fDOM signatures in tracking groundwater dispersal and transformation. We spatially mapped water column chemistry in Maunalua Bay, O ªahu, Hawai ªi by collecting 24 water samples in grids at each of two {\textasciitilde} 0.15 km2 regions during both high and low tides over a two-day period. We observed clear horizontal gradients in the majority of 15 measured parameters, including inorganic and organic solutes and organic particles that tracked concentrations of conservative SGD tracers (radon, salinity and silicate). Multivariate scanning excitation‚Äìemission fluorometry successfully differentiated two distinct groundwater sources and delineated regions of SGD dispersion in each reef from the surrounding water column samples without detectable groundwater. Groundwater was consistently depleted in DOC and enriched in nutrients; although the two SGD sources varied widely in fDOM quantity and fluorophore proportions, indices of humification were consistently elevated in SGD at both sites. Our results provide a robust spectral characterization of fDOM in SGD-influenced coral reefs and indicate the potential for this rapid and cost-effective measurement technique to be useful in tracking SGD dispersal in nearshore ecosystems.},

	abstract = {This study investigates optical and high-resolution molecular signatures and photochemical degradation of DOM from the Barra Bonita Reservoir (BB-DOM), a tropical eutrophic lake, as well as from its dominant phytoplankton species, the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa (Microcystis-DOM). Consistent with a predominantly autotrophic source, BB-DOM and Microcystis-DOM exhibited high protein-like fluorescence and contained a large number of aliphatics. Microcystis-DOM was enriched in peptide-like formulae, while BB-DOM had higher chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM) and was enriched in moderately unsaturated formulae, indicating additions of terrigenous DOM and/or in situ processing of autochthonous material in the lake. Consistent with its higher CDOM content, BB-DOM was more photoreactive than Microcystis-DOM. For both types of DOM, photodegradation resulted in loss of CDOM, FDOM, moderately unsaturated structures, high O/C and low H/C formulae, and preservation of aliphatics. The majority of photoproducts of 0.5 d irradiation were subsequently removed by day 7, and photoproducts represented a minor fraction of the photo-irradiated DOM. For BB-DOM, molecular formula photolability increased with increasing aromaticity index values, while for Microcystis-DOM, molecular formula photolability increased with molecular mass. Photodegradation increased the proportion of molecular formulae containing N (CHO + N) in BB-DOM, while the molecular mass and the proportion of CHO + N formulae decreased upon photo-irradiation of Microcystis-DOM. In concert, these molecular shifts due to photodegradation decreased the diversity of and increased the similarity between BB-DOM and Microcystis-DOM, suggesting the selective pressure exerted by photochemistry selects for the survival of similar compounds in both samples.},

	abstract = {Peptide analogs, such as leucine-methylcoumarinylamide (Leu-MCA) and Lucifer yellow anhydride-tetraalanine (LYA-Ala4), are often used as proxies to quantify extracellular peptidase activities, but how accurately these analogs represent natural peptides remains unclear. Here we compared hydrolysis rates of tetrapeptides alanine-valine-phenylalanine-alanine (AVFA) and tetraalanine (Ala4) with their corresponding LYA analogs along a salinity gradient in the northern Gulf of Mexico Mississippi River plume. Hydrolysis rates were generally similar, but not always, between natural peptides and their analogs in the plume water. For example, hydrolysis rates were similar between LYA-AVFA and AVFA at all stations except one. In contrast, hydrolysis rates of LYA-Ala4 were significantly higher than those of Ala4 at low-salinity (18‚Äì19) stations, but significantly lower at one high-salinity (36) station. These results suggest that relative activities of different types of peptidases, measured by the analogs or peptides, depended on biological and chemical properties at each station, such as abundance of certain ‚Äúopportuni-trophic‚Äù bacteria, including Flavobacterium, Ruegeria and Roseobacter. The produced fragments and amino acids from peptide hydrolysis implied further that the hydrolysis pathway depended on specific peptide substrate, and that the LYA tag affected the hydrolysis pathway. Taken together, this study validates the technique of using LYA analogs to study extracellular enzymatic activities, particularly the overall hydrolysis rate, and provides insights into the patterns of extracellular enzymatic activities in estuarine environments.},

Much of this organic matter is in the form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We investigated the activities of heterotrophic microbial communities responsible for DOC processing at three sites in the coastal Mid-Atlantic Bight/northern end of the South Atlantic Bight: near the Chesapeake Bay mouth, off Cape Hatteras, and near Cape Lookout, NC. Activities of endo- and exo-acting extracellular enzymes (polysaccharide hydrolases, and glucosidase and peptidases, respectively), and bacterial protein production were measured in surface and subsurface waters at the three stations. Total suspended material, cell counts, and particle-associated enzyme activities were also quantified. Water masses at each station showed distinct physical characteristics (temperature, salinity, total suspended material), and differed notably in rates and spectrum of enzyme activities, as well as in the fraction of particle-associated activities. Despite similar cell counts, bacterial productivity differed by a factor of ca. 30 among depths and stations. Glucosidase and peptidase activities differed by a factor of ca. 40 among stations, but the differences in enzyme activities among stations did not scale with the differences in bacterial productivity. Theoretical turnover times of dissolved carbohydrates ‚Äì calculated from total dissolved carbohydrate concentrations and polysaccharide hydrolase activities ‚Äì range from weeks to months, suggesting that dissolved carbohydrates may be among the components of DOC that can be advected from the Mid-Atlantic Bight into the open ocean, connecting the carbon cycle in the ocean margin with the ocean's interior.},

Here, we applied a commercially available in situ FOM fluorometer that was connected to a conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) sensors with a carousel multi-sampling system to determine full vertical profiles of the FOM in oceanic environments. It was shown that temperature standardization was necessary to produce robust depth profiles and was performed preceding calibration with a benchtop fluorometer. The calibrated output of the in situ fluorometer was linearly related to apparent oxygen utilization when corrected for differences in fluorometer response over the length of the cruise. The results of this study indicated that (1) in situ FOM fluorometers that are mounted on CTD systems can be used to study the distribution of FOM in the open ocean, and (2) temperature standardization and appropriate calibration are crucial to evaluate the distribution of FOM in the open ocean. Although we used a window filter (weighted average of the output) to overcome the low S/N ratio of the output of the in situ fluorometer, better S/N ratios for in situ fluorometers are expected for open ocean studies.},

	abstract = {River systems play a pivotal role in transporting and transforming organic carbon (OC) fixed by terrestrial primary production. However, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the connectivity of terrestrial, aquatic, and marine carbon budgets due to a lack of measurements along the lower (i.e. tidally-influenced) reaches of large river systems. For example, all estimates of carbon fluxes from the world's largest river, the Amazon, are based on measurements made at and upstream of √ìbidos, roughly 900 km from the mouth. Here we examine the evolution of OC concentrations and composition from √ìbidos to two discreet channels near the mouth of the Amazon River during five cruises from 2010 to 2012. OC characteristics of the Tapaj√≥s River, which enters the Amazon River downstream of √ìbidos, and the Tocantins River, which mixes with the Amazon River plume in the Atlantic Ocean, were also assessed.
The average concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) across the two main channels near the mouth was 0.6 ¬± 0.3 mg L‚àí 1 during the study period, decreasing from 1.2 ¬± 1.0 mg L‚àí 1 at √ìbidos. Average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, on the other hand, increased from 3.9 ¬± 0.6 mg L‚àí 1 at √ìbidos to 4.2 ¬± 0.9 mg L‚àí 1 across the mouth. The discharge of total OC to the ocean was composed of 89 ¬± 3\% dissolved load, compared to 76 ¬± 13\% at √ìbidos. Measurements of bulk OC stable isotopic signatures, chlorophyll a concentrations, and lignin phenol abundance were used to assess unique OC sources along the continuum. For example, the stable isotopic composition of POC and DOC indicated a replacement of highland forest-derived OC with lowland and floodplain-derived OC from √ìbidos to the mouth. Likewise, lignin phenol signatures showed an increase in the degradation state of vascular plant-derived OC from √ìbidos to the mouth. Results from this study illustrate that the abundance and composition of OC continue to evolve along the lower reaches of large tropical rivers, which has significant implications on estimations of geochemical fluxes to the ocean.},

We further competed these substrates in a combinatorial fashion to evaluate preferential substrate utilization in natural microbial assemblages. Several substrates displayed biphasic kinetic responses and variable respiration: assimilation ratios. Amino acids had the shortest turnover times and were taken up preferentially at ambient concentrations. We also identified a linear relationship between substrate uptake rates and affinity, suggesting that the microbial community optimizes the relative abundances of membrane transporters according to substrate demand. When competed against one another at saturating concentrations, substrate assimilation and respiration rates were enhanced or inhibited by up to two orders of magnitude, compared to competitor-free controls. Further, we describe an unexpected trend between the substrate energy density and turnover times, with more energetic, reduced carbon substrates turning over more slowly than more oxidized substrates.},

In this study, we sought to investigate the potential of AltSIO to alter the chemical composition of marine DOC by characterizing its capacity to metabolize a broad suite of environmentally relevant model substrates. Results showed that AltSIO had a particularly broad capacity to degrade carbohydrates relative to other marine bacteria characterized as generalist heterotrophs. Growth in seawater incubations amended with model neutral sugars and radiolabeled substrates showed that AltSIO preferentially utilized d-galactose and disaccharides, but showed little to no biomass incorporation or respiration of d-glucose. Lastly, analysis of ambient dissolved organic matter (DOM) from time-course mesocosms by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry showed that both AltSIO grown in pure culture and a mixed bacterial community significantly altered ambient DOM, yet the alteration appeared uniform across chemical classes for both treatments. This study provides insight into the physiological mechanisms of a globally distributed generalist bacterial taxon that has the capacity to significantly alter the geochemistry of marine DOM.},

After 28 days, samples were extensively photo-degraded based upon colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) photo-bleaching (\&gt; 95\%). Samples were solid phase extracted using PPL resin to isolate, concentrate and desalt the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the samples. Ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) enabled 3024 molecular formulas to be identified in the dark control. Photo-degradation decreased molecular diversity, with 2402 formulas assigned post-irradiation. Molecular formulas were classified based upon their photo-lability as 1) photo-resistant; 2) photo-labile; and, 3) photo-produced. Photo-resistant DOM made up 73\% of all formulas and was dominated by highly unsaturated molecular signatures consistent with carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules, suggesting that these apparently bio-refractory compounds may also survive multiple passages through sunlit surface waters and thus accumulate for timeframes exceeding ocean ventilation. Photo-labile DOM was enriched in low molecular weight formulas, aromatic molecular formulas, and sulfur and phosphorous containing formulas. Compounds containing both sulfur and nitrogen were particularly photo-labile and may represent an underappreciated component of the photo-reactive CDOM pool. Photo-produced DOM was enriched in higher molecular weight formulas, as well as aliphatic and peptide formulas. Molecular formulas are indexed by their photo-lability classification in the supplementary information.},

We harvested DOM produced by four coastal diatoms (Skeletonema marinoi, Chaetoceros socialis, Thalassiosira weissflogii, and Odontella aurita) subjected to depletion of nitrogen (N), silicon (Si), or N + Si simultaneously in batch culture and assessed its bioavailability to natural bacterioplankton communities using dilution batch-culture remineralization bioassays. Short-term, ecologically-relevant responses were affected both by diatom source species and by the nutrient stress under which the DOM was produced. Si-stress DOM was generally more bioavailable over the first week than that produced under N or N + Si stress, and led to higher bacterial growth efficiencies. In contrast, the amount of diatom-derived total organic carbon (TOC) that persisted over months in the same experiments differed among source diatom species, with no evidence of a nutrient stress effect. These results nuance the carbon overflow hypothesis of DOM release, which has been suggested to be maladaptive due to the possibility of DOC release allowing bacterioplankton to better compete for the same nutrient that is limiting the phytoplankton. Our results suggest that bacterial activity is most promoted when diatoms are limited by Si, a nutrient that is not subject to competition with bacteria. They imply that the identity of the nutrient that terminates a diatom bloom impacts heterotrophic activity in the short term; however, source diatom species has the greater influence on DOC persistence in surface waters and its potential export from the system.},

Improvements in analytical techniques have expanded our understanding of metabolomics and developments in computational tools have made metabolomics data accessible to a broad segment of the scientific community. Yet, metabolomics methods have only been applied to a limited number of projects in the marine environment.

	abstract = {Many environmental factors are thought to control the bioavailability of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) for marine microbes including its composition, the microbial community structure, and nutrient availability, yet which factors dominate at the ocean basin scale remains uncertain. Understanding the controls on DOM lability is an important goal given the role of DOM in the marine carbon cycle. We performed DOM lability experiments at two contrasting stations, one oligotrophic and one mesotrophic, in the eastern tropical South Pacific (ETSP) to investigate the controls on microbial remineralization of surface ocean DOM. Surface layer dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) were recalcitrant to remineralization over 9 to 14 days when exposed to the microbial communities from the surface mixed layer, however exposure to microbial communities from the upper mesopelagic (twilight zone) allowed consumption of DOC but not DON. The DOC remineralization response differed between the mesotrophic site ({\textasciitilde} 21 ŒºM consumed), likely experiencing allochthonous inputs of DOM from the adjacent eastern boundary upwelling system, versus the oligotrophic station ({\textasciitilde} 3 ŒºM consumed) further offshore in the South Pacific gyre. DNA fingerprinting of the microbial communities across the ETSP with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses revealed greater differences between microbial communities in surface vs. subsurface (e.g., 100 m) waters at the same station than between surface water microbial communities separated by 1000s of kilometers. The subsurface microbial community at the mesotrophic station responsible for the greatest observed DOC remineralization, with a concomitant consumption of nitrate, consumed DOC to concentrations below that observed in situ (at 100 m), suggesting a potential role for co-metabolism of relatively labile with more recalcitrant DOC or relief from micronutrient limitation, in driving the additional DOC consumption. DOC remineralization by the mesopelagic (200 m) microbial community was much less at the oligotrophic station and similar to previously published results from the Sargasso Sea. Both microbial community composition and nutrient availability contribute to DOM persistence over weekly timescales in the surface mixed layer with varying degrees of DOC lability in the subsurface waters of the ETSP.},

	abstract = {Most marine DOC is thought to be biologically-recalcitrant, especially that in the deep ocean pool (\&gt; 1000 m). In particular, the deep waters of the North Pacific should contain the most recalcitrant DOC because they do not form locally, with deep DOC having survived long isolation from the surface during global-scale thermohaline circulation. One of the proposed removal pathways involves photochemical reactions when refractory DOC circulates through sunlit surface waters (Mopper et al., 1991). Here, we reevaluate the general photoreactivity of refractory DOC by investigating the photochemical production of two reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2‚àí), using controlled irradiations at sea and in the laboratory. The photoproduction of these two ROS were compared between deep and surface water samples collected in the Gulf of Alaska. For irradiated samples, initial superoxide steady-state concentrations ([O2‚àí]ss) and first-order decay constants (kpseudo) were similar between surface and deep waters, ranging from {\textasciitilde} 1‚Äì4 nM and 4‚Äì12 √ó 10‚àí 3 s‚àí 1, respectively. Initial photoproduction rates were comparable between surface and deep waters, ranging from 22‚Äì173 nM h‚àí 1 for O2‚àí and from 1‚Äì8.3 nM h‚àí 1 for H2O2, indicating that a large portion of photoproduced O2‚àí does not lead to H2O2 formation. In fact, the photoproduction ratio of O2‚àí to H2O2 averaged {\textasciitilde} 4:1 in paired experiments, instead of the 2:1 stoichiometry expected for O2‚àí dismutation to form H2O2. Continued irradiation for up to 48 h showed photoproduced H2O2 to be much lower in deep samples compared to surface samples with accumulation slowing or stopping in deep samples despite both measurable [O2‚àí]ss and photon absorbance by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). These results are consistent with a loss of source material (i.e. CDOM) for O2‚àí photoproduction and a shift to a predominantly oxidative pathway for O2‚àí decay. Low photoproduction rates, loss of continued accumulation with extended radiation, and an apparent loss of O2‚àí source material argues that the deep refractory DOC pool is less photochemically reactive than previously suggested.},

We detected high concentrations of dissolved CH4 in the ocean above the seafloor with a sharp decrease above the pycnocline. Model approaches taking potential CH4 emissions from both dissolved and bubble-released CH4 from a larger region into account reveal a maximum flux compatible with the observed atmospheric CH4 mixing ratios of 2.4‚Äì3.8‚Äânmol‚Äâm‚àí2‚Äâs‚àí1. This is too low to have an impact on the atmospheric summer CH4 budget in the year 2014.

If these CH4 hydrates could be converted into CO2 hydrates, they would serve double duty as CH4 sources and CO2 storage sites. We explore here the swapping phenomenon occurring in structure I (sI) and structure II (sII) CH4 hydrate deposits through spectroscopic analyses and its potential application to CO2 sequestration at the preliminary phase. The present 85\% CH4 recovery rate in sI CH4 hydrate achieved by the direct use of binary N2 + CO2 guests is surprising when compared with the rate of 64\% for a pure CO2 guest attained in the previous approach. The direct use of a mixture of N2 + CO2 eliminates the requirement of a CO2 separation/purification process. In addition, the simultaneously occurring dual mechanism of CO2 sequestration and CH4 recovery is expected to provide the physicochemical background required for developing a promising large-scale approach with economic feasibility. In the case of sII CH4 hydrates, we observe a spontaneous structure transition of sII to sI during the replacement and a cage-specific distribution of guest molecules. A significant change of the lattice dimension caused by structure transformation induces a relative number of small cage sites to reduce, resulting in the considerable increase of CH4 recovery rate. The mutually interactive pattern of targeted guest‚Äìcage conjugates possesses important implications for the diverse hydrate-based inclusion phenomena as illustrated in the swapping process between CO2 stream and complex CH4 hydrate structure.},

	abstract = {Warming of high-latitude continental-margin oceans has the potential to 
release large quantities of carbon from gas hydrate and other
sedimentary reservoirs. To assess how carbon mobilized from the seafloor
might amplify global warming or alter ocean chemistry, a robust analysis
of the concentrations and isotopic content of methane and carbon dioxide
(CO2) in the water column and atmosphere is required. To this effect, a
gas analysis system consisting of three cavity ring-down spectrometers
was developed to obtain a real-time, three-dimensional characterization
of the distribution and isotopic variability of methane and CO2 at a
shallow ({\textless}100 m water depth) bubbling methane seep offshore of
western Svalbard. Surface water methane concentrations from the
continuous-flow CRDS system agreed remarkably well with discrete samples
analyzed by the GC-based headspace analysis technique and with a
CRDS-based discrete sample analysis module. Reliable carbon isotope data
were also obtained from the CRDSs once an isotopic calibration routine
was applied. The resulting data revealed that CO2 uptake from the
atmosphere within the surface water methane plume overlying the gas seep
was elevated by 36-45\% relative to surrounding waters. In comparison to
the positive radiative forcing effect expected from the methane
emissions, the negative radiative forcing potential from CO2 uptake was
32-43 times greater. Lower water temperatures, elevated
chlorophyll-fluorescence and 13C-enriched CO2 within the surface methane
plume suggest that bubble-driven upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water
stimulated CO2 uptake by phytoplankton. The observation that a shallow
methane seep has a net negative radiative forcing effect challenges the
widely-held perception that methane seeps contribute to the global
atmospheric greenhouse gas burden.},

Strong emissions of methane have recently been observed from shallow sediments in Arctic seas. Berndt et al. (p. 284, published online 2 January) present a record of methane seepage from marine sediments off the coast of Svalbard showing that such emissions have been present for at least 3000 years, the result of normal seasonal fluctuations of bottom waters. Thus, contemporary observations of strong methane venting do not necessarily mean that the clathrates that are the source of the methane are decomposing at a faster rate than in the past.
Methane hydrate is an icelike substance that is stable at high pressure and low temperature in continental margin sediments. Since the discovery of a large number of gas flares at the landward termination of the gas hydrate stability zone off Svalbard, there has been concern that warming bottom waters have started to dissociate large amounts of gas hydrate and that the resulting methane release may possibly accelerate global warming. Here, we corroborate that hydrates play a role in the observed seepage of gas, but we present evidence that seepage off Svalbard has been ongoing for at least 3000 years and that seasonal fluctuations of 1¬∞ to 2¬∞C in the bottom-water temperature cause periodic gas hydrate formation and dissociation, which focus seepage at the observed sites.
Seasonal gas hydrate destabilization has been releasing methane from marine sediments near Svalbard for at least 3000 years.

	abstract = {Sea ice in the Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing components of the global climate system. Over the past few decades, summer areal extent has declined over 30\%, and all months show statistically significant declining trends. New satellite missions and techniques have greatly expanded information on sea ice thickness, but many uncertainties remain in the satellite data and long-term records are sparse. However, thickness observations and other satellite-derived data indicate a 40\% decline in thickness, due in large part to the loss of thicker, older ice cover. The changes in sea ice are happening faster than models have projected. With continued increasing temperatures, summer ice-free conditions are likely sometime in the coming decades, though there are substantial uncertainties in the exact timing and high interannual variability will remain as sea ice decreases. The changes in Arctic sea ice are already having an impact on flora and fauna in the Arctic. Some species will face increasing challenges in the future, while new habitat will open up for other species. The changes are also affecting people living and working in the Arctic. Native communities are facing challenges to their traditional ways of life, while new opportunities open for shipping, fishing, and natural resource extraction. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding of Arctic sea ice and its role in climate, the ecosystem, and human activities.

Spectral and chemical analyses show carbohydrates, proteins, and structurally complex carboxyl-rich aliphatic matter (CRAM) contribute the majority of characterized material. The chemical composition of DOM has a large impact on its accumulation and residence time in the ocean. Carbohydrates and proteins are cycled much more quickly, have much shorter residence times and lower global inventories than CRAM. Processes that lead to the accumulation of carbohydrates and proteins are highly selective, and only a specific fraction of these biopolymers escape degradation to accumulate as DOM. The origin and fate of CRAM are largely unknown, although recent studies suggest a portion of this material has been subjected to elevated temperatures, either in hydrothermal systems or during biomass burning of terrestrial organic matter before transport to the ocean. Radiocarbon measurements and global surveys of deep-sea DOM concentration are providing new insights into the location and timescale of refractory DOM removal processes, significantly enhancing our understanding of CRAM cycling.},

	abstract = {At 662 Pg C, marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents the largest pool of reduced carbon and associated elements in the ocean. The flux of carbon and associated elements through the DOM pool operates on time scales that are both ecologically and biogeochemically relevant. As a byproduct of biological productivity a portion of autochthonous DOM production turns over rapidly, serving as a substrate that fuels heterotrophic microbial activity and the fast biogeochemical cycling of elements. Although \&gt; 50\% of the carbon fixed by photo and chemoautotrophy is routed through DOM and processed by heterotrophic microbes, there are numerous biotic and abiotic processes that also alter DOM reactivity, decoupling its production from consumption, resulting in its accumulation. The controls on the redistribution of DOM can play an important role in carbon export and it potential sequestration. This chapter reviews the many production and consumption processes that control the fluxes, accumulation, and inventory of DOM in the ocean. We review (1) the biotic mechanisms of DOM production, (2) the biotic and abiotic processes controlling DOM removal, (3) the numerous factors and processes leading to DOM accumulation, we then (4) examine DOM fractions in terms of biological lability and ecological and biogeochemical significance, and (5) describe our current understanding of the global ocean DOC budget.},

	abstract = {A new approach for parameterizing dissolved organic matter (DOM) ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra is presented. Two distinct spectral slope regions (275-295 nm and 350-400 nm) within log-transformed absorption spectra were used to compare DOM from contrasting water types, ranging from wetlands (Great Dismal Swamp and Suwannee River) to photobleached oceanic water (Atlantic Ocean). On the basis of DOM size-fractionation studies (ultrafiltration and gel filtration chromatography), the slope of the 275-295-nm region and the ratio of these slopes (SR; 275-295-nm slope : 350-400-nm slope) were related to DOM molecular weight (MW) and to photochemically induced shifts in MW. Dark aerobic microbial alteration of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) resulted in spectral slope changes opposite of those caused by photochemistry. Along an axial transect in the Delaware Estuary, large variations in SR were measured, probably due to mixing, photodegradation, and microbial alteration of CDOM as terrestrially derived DOM transited through the estuary. Further, SR varied by over a factor of 13 between DOM-rich wetland waters and Sargasso Sea surface waters. Currently, there is no consensus on a wavelength range for log-transformed absorption spectra. We propose that the 275-295-nm slope be routinely reported in future DOM studies, as it can be measured with high precision, it facilitates comparison among dissimilar water types including CDOM-rich wetland and CDOM-poor marine waters, and it appears to be a good proxy for DOM MW.},

	abstract = {The use of vanadium (III) has been proposed recently as a suitable alternative to cadmium for the reduction of NO3‚àí to NO2‚àí during spectrophotometric analysis. However, the methods proposed suffer from decreased sensitivity and additional steps for the measurements of nitrite and nitrate. We have developed an improved fast and sequential protocol that permits the determination of low concentrations of nitrite and nitrate in marine and freshwater samples using small volumes. NO2‚àí concentration is firstly determined by using the common Griess reaction. The subsequent addition of a 2\% VCl3 solution in 6 N HCl in the same sample and the reaction at 60 ¬∞C for 25 min results in an efficient reduction of the NO3‚àí to NO2‚àí (\&gt; 95\%), which is also detected by the already added Griess reagents. The method has a detection limit \&lt; 0.05 ŒºM, a high precision (ranging from 0.2 to 11\%) and accuracy (0.07 ŒºM) for the determination of NO3‚àí + NO2‚àí concentrations lower than 30 ŒºM. Comparison of the proposed method with the established Cd column method using samples from a variety of environments (fresh water reservoir, sediment freeze lysable pore water, estuarine water samples and samples from an acid mine drainage impacted reservoir) showed good agreement between the two methods, with a difference between methods of 0.073 ¬± 0.099 ŒºM. The analysis can be performed in large batches ({\textasciitilde} 60 samples) by using small sample volumes (‚â§ 1 mL) for the determination of both NO3‚àí and NO2‚àí in less than 1 h.},

	abstract = {In this contribution a method to analyse nitrate in marine pore water, seawater and freshwater is presented. The method serves to replace the well-known cadmium column method for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. Instead, acidic vanadium(III)-solution is used for the reduction avoiding the toxic Cd metal. Both, the already present and the newly produced nitrite are quantified by the established Griess‚ÄìIlosvay reaction. Sample preparation is easy because only one reagent solution has to be added to the sample. Efficiency of the nitrate reduction is 100 ¬± 3\% (n = 12) using either a reaction time of 60 min at 45 ¬∞C or 10‚Äì20 h at room temperature. Measurements can either be done by conventional UV‚ÄìVIS spectrophotometry using 1‚Äì5 cm cuvettes, by discrete sequential analysers based on the loop flow technique, by continuous flow technique or, when only small sample volumes are available, by microtiter plate readers (MR) in absorbance mode. The latter method requires only 0.5 mL of a sample for nitrite and nitrate quantification and has a precision of 2\%. The limit of detection of the MR technique is comparable to conventional methods using a 1 cm cuvette (0.4 ŒºM for nitrate, 0.07 ŒºM for nitrite). The method requires only a spectrophotometer, and is simple and cost-effective; sample preparation is rapid and a salt error or an interference by dissolved organic carbon is not evident. Interferences induced by naturally coloured samples, or hydrogen sulphide can be corrected or eliminated. A procedure for direct nitrate determination is given as well as a procedure to compensate for the small loss of nitrite by nitric oxide formation for the nitrite present prior to the addition of a reductant.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICRMS) has provided extensive molecular mass data for complex natural organic matter (NOM). Structural information can be deduced solely from the molecular masses for ions with extreme molecular element ratios, in particular low H/C ratios, which are abundant in thermally altered NOM (e.g. black carbon). In this communication we propose a general aromaticity index (AI) and two threshold values as unequivocal criteria for the existence of either aromatic (AI‚Äâ{\textgreater}‚Äâ0.5) or condensed aromatic structures (AI‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ0.67) in NOM. AI can be calculated from molecular formulae which are derived from exact molecular masses of naturally occurring compounds containing C, H, O, N, S and P, and is especially useful for substances with aromatic cores and few alkylations. In order to test the validity of our model index, AI is applied to FTICRMS data of a NOM deep-water sample from the Weddell Sea (Antarctica), a fulvic acid standard, and an artificial dataset of all theoretically possible molecular formulae. For graphical evaluation a ternary plot is suggested for four-dimensional data representation. The proposed aromaticity index is a step towards structural identification of NOM and the molecular identification of polyaromatic hydrocarbons in the environment.

This review focuses on current approaches to the chemical structural characterization of DOM, ranging from those applicable to bulk samples and in situ analyses (UV-visible spectrophotometry and fluorescence spectroscopy) through the concentration/isolation of DOM followed by the application of one or more analytical techniques, to the detailed separation and analysis of individual compounds or compound classes.

Principal component analysis (PCA) illustrated a shift towards C1\% with photo-exposure in addition to distinguishing compositions of C1‚Äì5\% in Beaufort Sea halocline and Atlantic layer as well as NASG deep water masses. When Beaufort Sea water masses were considered, k of C2 was found to be lower in upper (UH) and mid (MH) halocline layers when compared to lower halocline (LH) and underlying Atlantic layer (AL; p \&lt; 0.10). This suggested that C2 in Pacific-derived seawater was less photoreactive than C2 in Atlantic-derived seawater in Beaufort Sea, likely as a result of distinct formation pathways of these water masses. Similarly, C2 in upper Labrador Seawater (ULSW) and ‚Äòclassical‚Äô Labrador seawater (LSW) was less photolabile than in deeper NASG layers (Iceland-Scotland and Denmark Strait overflow waters; ISOW and DSOW).

With this approach, complicated mass spectra can be visualized in a way that allows for (1) possible reaction pathways to be identified and presented, and (2) qualitative analyses on major classes of compounds that comprise ultrahigh-resolution spectra. The qualitative analyses are in a good agreement with results obtained from analyses by other analytical techniques. Additionally, the van Krevelen diagram can be expanded to a 3D plot by using peak intensities or relative intensities as the z-axis. The 3D van Krevelen diagram allows for an evaluation of the relative significance of structurally related compounds. The 3D plot can also be a useful tool for compositional differentiation among samples.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its bulk chemical composition was examined on three dates at 10 sites on the Ogeechee River, a blackwater river in Georgia. Samples of riverine DOM were concentrated from filtered river water using reverse osmosis. In addition, particulate organic matter (POM), in the form of leaf litter, algae, and macrophytes, was leached with synthetic rainwater to obtain fresh DOM. Elemental composition, carboxylic acid content, and bacterial growth were measured on all samples. The results of this study indicate that fresh DOM in POM leachates is generally more bioavailable than riverine DOM. The bioavailability of riverine DOM appears to be greater under low discharge conditions and decreases with distance downstream. The bioavailability of all DOM samples is very well predicted (r2 = 0.93, n = 20) by an empirical equation of the form: bioavailability = a0 + a1(H:C) + a2(O:C) + a3(N:C). When compositional data are plotted on a van Krevelen diagram, it is evident that POM leachates and, to a lesser degree, DOM from headwater sites have compositions that differ little from simple mixtures of major components of biomass (lipids, sugars, proteins, and lignins). Father downstream, major diagenetic alteration of organic matter is evident from the compositions of DOM samples, whose H: C and O: C ratios are lower and higher, respectively, than for any possible mixture of biomass components. Bioavailability of DOM is closely related to the percentage of aliphatic carbon in a sample, and downstream decreases in bioavailability are mainly attributable to selective degradation of aliphatic carbon in riverine DOM.},

	abstract = {DOM represents the largest reservoir of organic carbon stored in the oceans. Its source has been proposed to originate from marine primary and bacterial production, with limited land-derived contributors. Marine DOM is a complex mixture of biomolecules that either exist naturally or have been transformed from living and decaying organisms in the ocean. Previous research has identified only a small portion of deep sea DOM, due to the complexity of the mixture and lack of advanced techniques available; however, ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry has succeeded for DOM characterization where other techniques have failed. In Chapter 3, we compare ultrahigh resolution mass spectra of marine DOM isolated from two sites in the Weddell Sea (Antarctica) using ESI and Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization (APPI). These spectra, obtained on a 9.4 Tesla FT-ICR-MS, indicate the two ionization techniques are complementary. Ions produced by APPI extend to higher carbon undersaturation compared to ESI, indicated by higher double-bond equivalence minus oxygen (DBE-O) values, while ions in the ESI spectra are more oxygenated. Moreover, many sulfur-containing compounds were efficiently ionized by ESI but not detected by APPI. These results show that the differences in mass spectra obtained by ESI and APPI FT-ICR-MS are significant and that both are necessary to obtain a complete description of the molecular composition of marine DOM.
Peatlands are extraordinary carbon reservoirs due to their sequestration and emission of greenhouse gases. Chapter 4 depicts the importance of investigating the molecular characterization of terrestrial DOM from the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (GLAP) of northern Minnesota, to reveal the potentially pivotal role it plays in global carbon cycling. ESI-FT-ICR-MS was used to identify the qualitative differences between DOM in fen and bog porewaters of the Red Lake II system in the GLAP. Approximately 80\% of molecular composition observed in surface porewater was maintained throughout the bog profile (0.17 to 2.50m). The qualitative stability of the molecular composition of DOM was accompanied by a quantitative increase in Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) with depth. The composition of DOM in the fen was significantly different at depth with slightly varying DOC levels. Using Aromaticity Index (AI) values we identified condensed aromatic phenol-type compounds in the porewaters of both peatlands. Surface bog and deep fen DOM had surprising similar molecular compositions. We suggest that enzymatic degradation via phenol oxidase and slower hydrologic transport down the bog vertical profile are responsible for the observed variations in DOM composition.
In Chapter 5, molecular composition and optical properties were correlated for two samples of DOM from different peat formations in the GLAP. Fen and bog DOM were analyzed using 9.4 T FT-ICR-MS to determine the aromatic content as a function of depth. UV/Vis absorbance and Excitation Emission Matrix Fluorescence Spectroscopy (EEMS) were used to identify changes in the optical properties associated with the chromophoric fractions of DOM (CDOM). Higher specific UV absorbance (SUVA) at 254 nm indicated more abundant aromatic content for surface bog and deep fen DOM. EEMS results were also found to be in agreement with the absorption spectra and molecular characterization as determined by FT-ICR-MS. The strong correlations we have observed suggest that optical spectroscopy techniques represent an effective surrogate approach to characterizing DOM provided some detailed molecular information is available for calibrating the observed correlations.
Finally, comparative analysis of sample preparatory methods for ESI-FT-ICR-MS is presented for terrestrial DOM in Chapter 6. Freeze drying and solid phase extraction using a modified styrene divinyl benzene polymer sorbent (Varian PPL) were considered. Molecular composition was determined using a 9.4Tesla ESI-FT-ICR-MS for Red Lake II fen and bog DOM of the GLAP. 78\% of the DOM composition was found to be common to both freeze dried and SPE Bog 0.17m. The unique SPE Bog 0.17m molecular formulas were characterized by higher aromaticity index values and higher DBE-O values which correspond to more aromatic and condensed structures. Similar results were observed for Fen 2.50m DOM. Mass spectral comparisons of SPE DOM and salt water treated SPE DOM produced 93\% and 94\% common molecular formulas for Fen 2.50m and Bog 0.17m respectively. No outstanding signature originating from the SPE cartridge or by saltwater contributions was identified. The results emphasize the ability of SPE to elute a more representative and effectively prepared DOM sample for high resolution ESI-FT-ICR-MS. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)},

	abstract = {The pelagic realm of the dark ocean represents a key site for remineralization of organic matter and long-term carbon storage and burial in the biosphere. It contains the largest pool of microbes in aquatic systems, harboring nearly 75\% and 50\% of the prokaryotic biomass and production, respectively, of the global ocean. Genomic approaches continue to uncover the enormous and dynamic genetic variability at phylogenetic and functional levels. Deep-sea prokaryotes have comparable or even higher cell-specific extracellular enzymatic activity than do microbes in surface waters, with a high fraction of freely released exoenzymes, probably indicative of a life mode reliant on surface attachment to particles or colloids. Additionally, evidence increases that chemoautotrophy might represent a significant CO2 sink and source of primary production in the dark ocean. Recent advances challenge the paradigm of stable microbial food web structure and function and slow organic-matter cycling. However, knowledge of deep-ocean food webs is still rudimentary. Dynamics of particle transformation and fate of the exported material in deep waters are still largely unknown. Discrepancies exist between estimates of carbon fluxes and remineralization rates. Recent assessments, however, suggest that integrated respiration in the dark ocean's water column is comparable to that in the epipelagic zone, and that the dark ocean is a site of paramount importance for material cycling in the biosphere. The advent of new molecular tools and in situ sampling methodologies will improve knowledge of the dark ocean's microbial ecosystem and resolve current discrepancies between carbon sources and metabolic requirements of deep-sea microbes.},

	abstract = {The oceans have absorbed nearly half of the fossil-fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the atmosphere since pre-industrial times, causing a measurable reduction in seawater pH and carbonate saturation. If CO2 emissions continue to rise at current rates, upper-ocean pH will decrease to levels lower than have existed for tens of millions of years and, critically, at a rate of change 100 times greater than at any time over this period. Recent studies have shown effects of ocean acidification on a variety of marine life forms, in particular calcifying organisms. Consequences at the community to ecosystem level, in contrast, are largely unknown. Here we show that dissolved inorganic carbon consumption of a natural plankton community maintained in mesocosm enclosures at initial CO2 partial pressures of 350, 700 and 1,050 Œºatm increases with rising CO2. The community consumed up to 39\% more dissolved inorganic carbon at increased CO2 partial pressures compared to present levels, whereas nutrient uptake remained the same. The stoichiometry of carbon to nitrogen drawdown increased from 6.0 at low CO2 to 8.0 at high CO2, thus exceeding the Redfield carbon:nitrogen ratio of 6.6 in today‚Äôs ocean. This excess carbon consumption was associated with higher loss of organic carbon from the upper layer of the stratified mesocosms. If applicable to the natural environment, the observed responses have implications for a variety of marine biological and biogeochemical processes, and underscore the importance of biologically driven feedbacks in the ocean to global change.},

However, little information exists on the specific metabolic functions of participating bacteria and on whether individual taxa specialize on particular components of the marine DOC pool. Here we use experimental metagenomics to show that coastal communities are populated by taxa capable of metabolizing a wide variety of organic carbon compounds. Genomic DNA captured from bacterial community subsets metabolizing a single model component of the DOC pool (either dimethylsulphoniopropionate or vanillate) showed substantial overlap in gene composition as well as a diversity of carbon-processing capabilities beyond the selected phenotypes. Our direct measure of niche breadth for bacterial functional assemblages indicates that, in accordance with ecological theory, heterogeneity in the composition and supply of organic carbon to coastal oceans may favour generalist bacteria. In the important interplay between microbial community structure and biogeochemical cycling, coastal heterotrophic communities may be controlled less by transient changes in the carbon reservoir that they process and more by factors such as trophic interactions and physical conditions.},

	abstract = {This paper synthesizes current ideas on the role of the microbial loop in carbon fluxes in the ocean and proposes some directions for future research. Organic matter flux into bacteria is highly variable, which can significantly influence the pathways of carbon flow in the ocean. A goal for future research is to elucidate the mechanistic bases of bacteria-organic matter coupling. This research should take into consideration the micrometer-scale distribution of bacteria and the composition, structure, and dynamics of the organic matter field in the bacterium's microhabitat. The ideas on the interactions of bacteria with the particulate organic phase need to be revised in view of recent findings of highly abundant, previously unknown particles ranging in size from nanometers to hundreds of micrometers. The ‚Äúhot-spots‚Äù in the distribution of organic matter and remineralized nutrients can influence the rates as well as the direction of biogeochemical fluxes. Slow-to-degrade dissolved organic matter (DOM) may be produced because of loose bacteria-organic matter coupling resulting in DOM storage. Its use at a later time and place has profound implications for carbon fluxes and food web dynamics. A fundamental research need for the future is to understand the ecological interactions among the members of the microbial loop in an appropriate microhabitat context. While this goal was previously intractable, new molecular and optical techniques should make it possible to understand the biogeochemical activities of the microbial loop in terms of the ecology and evolution of pelagic microbial communities.},

	abstract = {The methane-emitting cold seeps of Hikurangi margin (New Zealand) are among the few deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems of the Southern Hemisphere known to date. Here we compared the biogeochemistry and microbial communities of a variety of Hikurangi cold seep ecosystems. These included highly reduced seep habitats dominated by bacterial mats, partially oxidized habitats populated by heterotrophic ampharetid polychaetes and deeply oxidized habitats dominated by chemosynthetic frenulate tubeworms. The ampharetid habitats were characterized by a thick oxic sediment layer that hosted a diverse and biomass-rich community of aerobic methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria. These bacteria consumed up to 25\% of the emanating methane and clustered within three deep-branching groups named Marine Methylotrophic Group (MMG) 1-3. MMG1 and MMG2 methylotrophs belong to the order Methylococcales, whereas MMG3 methylotrophs are related to the Methylophaga. Organisms of the groups MMG1 and MMG3 are close relatives of chemosynthetic endosymbionts of marine invertebrates. The anoxic sediment layers of all investigated seeps were dominated by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) of the ANME-2 clade and sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria. Microbial community analysis using Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) showed that the different seep habitats hosted distinct microbial communities, which were strongly influenced by the seep-associated fauna and the geographic location. Despite outstanding features of Hikurangi seep communities, the organisms responsible for key ecosystem functions were similar to those found at seeps worldwide. This suggests that similar types of biogeochemical settings select for similar community composition regardless of geographic distance. Because ampharetid polychaetes are widespread at cold seeps the role of aerobic methanotrophy may have been underestimated in seafloor methane budgets.},

They are highly reduced benthic habitats and often associated with intensive methane seepage. In this study, the microbial diversity and community structure in methane-rich sediments of the Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV) were investigated by comparative sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescence in situ hybridization. In the active volcano center, which has a diameter of about 500 m, the main methane-consuming process was bacterial aerobic oxidation. In this zone, aerobic methanotrophs belonging to three bacterial clades closely affiliated with Methylobacter and Methylophaga species accounted for 56\% ¬± 8\% of total cells. In sediments below Beggiatoa mats encircling the center of the HMMV, methanotrophic archaea of the ANME-3 clade dominated the zone of anaerobic methane oxidation. ANME-3 archaea form cell aggregates mostly associated with sulfate-reducing bacteria of the Desulfobulbus (DBB) branch. These ANME-3/DBB aggregates were highly abundant and accounted for up to 94\% ¬± 2\% of total microbial biomass at 2 to 3 cm below the surface. ANME-3/DBB aggregates could be further enriched by flow cytometry to identify their phylogenetic relationships. At the outer rim of the mud volcano, the seafloor was colonized by tubeworms (Siboglinidae, formerly known as Pogonophora). Here, both aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidizers were found, however, in lower abundances. The level of microbial diversity at this site was higher than that at the central and Beggiatoa species-covered part of the HMMV. Analysis of methyl-coenzyme M-reductase alpha subunit (mcrA) genes showed a strong dominance of a novel lineage, mcrA group f, which could be assigned to ANME-3 archaea. Our results further support the hypothesis of Niemann et al. (54), that high methane availability and different fluid flow regimens at the HMMV provide distinct niches for aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs.},

	abstract = {Biogenic methane is widely thought to be a product of archaeal methanogenesis, an anaerobic process that is inhibited or outcompeted by the presence of oxygen and sulfate. Yet a large fraction of marine methane delivered to the atmosphere is produced in high-sulfate, fully oxygenated surface waters that have methane concentrations above atmospheric equilibrium values, an unexplained phenomenon referred to as the marine methane paradox. Here we use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that polysaccharide esters of three phosphonic acids are important constituents of dissolved organic matter in seawater from the North Pacific. In seawater and pure culture incubations, bacterial degradation of these dissolved organic matter phosphonates in the presence of oxygen releases methane, ethylene and propylene gas. Moreover, we found that in mutants of a methane-producing marine bacterium, Pseudomonas stutzeri, disrupted in the C‚ÄìP lyase phosphonate degradation pathway, methanogenesis was also disabled, indicating that the C‚ÄìP lyase pathway can catalyse methane production from marine dissolved organic matter. Finally, the carbon stable isotope ratio of methane emitted during our incubations agrees well with anomalous isotopic characteristics of seawater methane. We estimate that daily cycling of only about 0.25\% of the organic matter phosphonate inventory would support the entire atmospheric methane flux at our study site. We conclude that aerobic bacterial degradation of phosphonate esters in dissolved organic matter may explain the marine methane paradox.},

Here, we show that more than 5000 at-sea observations of dissolved methane demonstrates that greater than 80\% of ESAS bottom waters and greater than 50\% of surface waters are supersaturated with methane regarding to the atmosphere. The current atmospheric venting flux, which is composed of a diffusive component and a gradual ebullition component, is on par with previous estimates of methane venting from the entire World Ocean. Leakage of methane through shallow ESAS waters needs to be considered in interactions between the biogeosphere and a warming Arctic climate.
Methane emissions from this region of sub-sea permafrost are comparable to previous estimates for the world ocean.

	abstract = {A large fraction of globally produced methane is converted to CO2 by anaerobic oxidation in marine sediments. Strong geochemical evidence for net methane consumption in anoxic sediments is based on methane profiles, radiotracer experiments and stable carbon isotope data. But the elusive microorganisms mediating this reaction have not yet been isolated, and the pathway of anaerobic oxidation of methane is insufficiently understood. Recent data suggest that certain archaea reverse the process of methanogenesis by interaction with sulphate-reducing bacteria. Here we provide microscopic evidence for a structured consortium of archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria, which we identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization using specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. In this example of a structured archaeal-bacterial symbiosis, the archaea grow in dense aggregates of about 100 cells and are surrounded by sulphate-reducing bacteria. These aggregates were abundant in gas-hydrate-rich sediments with extremely high rates of methane-based sulphate reduction, and apparently mediate anaerobic oxidation of methane.},

	abstract = {Cold seep ecosystems can support enormous biomasses of free-living and symbiotic chemoautotrophic organisms that get their energy from the oxidation of methane or sulfide. Most of this biomass derives from animals that are associated with bacterial symbionts, which are able to metabolize the chemical resources provided by the seeping fluids. Often these systems also harbor dense accumulations of non-symbiotic megafauna, which can be relevant in exporting chemosynthetically fixed carbon from seeps to the surrounding deep sea. Here we investigated the carbon sources of lithodid crabs (Paralomis sp.) feeding on thiotrophic bacterial mats at an active mud volcano at the Costa Rica subduction zone. To evaluate the dietary carbon source of the crabs, we compared the microbial community in stomach contents with surface sediments covered by microbial mats. The stomach content analyses revealed a dominance of epsilonproteobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences related to the free-living and epibiotic sulfur oxidiser Sulfurovum sp. We also found Sulfurovum sp. as well as members of the genera Arcobacter and Sulfurimonas in mat-covered surface sediments where Epsilonproteobacteria were highly abundant constituting 10\% of total cells. Furthermore, we detected substantial amounts of bacterial fatty acids such as i-C15‚à∂0 and C17‚à∂1œâ6c with stable carbon isotope compositions as low as ‚àí53‚Ä∞ in the stomach and muscle tissue. These results indicate that the white microbial mats at Mound 12 are comprised of Epsilonproteobacteria and that microbial mat-derived carbon provides an important contribution to the crab's nutrition. In addition, our lipid analyses also suggest that the crabs feed on other 13C-depleted organic matter sources, possibly symbiotic megafauna as well as on photosynthetic carbon sources such as sedimentary detritus.},

	abstract = {Light absorption of the colored fraction of dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a dominant optical component of the Arctic Ocean (AO). Here we show Pan-Arctic characteristics of CDOM light absorption for various Arctic regions covering both coastal and oceanic waters during the Tara Oceans Polar Circle expedition. The Siberian (or eastern) side of the AO is characterized by higher CDOM absorption values compared to the North American (or western) side. This is due to the difference in watersheds between the eastern and western sides of the AO and is consistent with an Arctic absorption database recently built by Matsuoka et al. (2014). A direct comparison between in situ and satellite data demonstrates that CDOM absorption is derived Arctic-wide from satellite ocean color data with an average uncertainty of 12\% (root mean square error of 0.3 m‚àí 1) using our previously published algorithm. For river-influenced coastal waters, we found a single and highly significant relationship between concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CDOM absorption (r2 \&gt; 0.94) covering major Arctic river mouths. By applying this in situ relationship to satellite-derived CDOM absorption, DOC concentrations in the surface waters are estimated for river-influenced coastal waters with an average uncertainty of 28\%. Implications for the monitoring of DOC concentrations in Arctic coastal waters are discussed.},

Freshwater sediment slurries were incubated anaerobically with added sulfate and acetate to promote sulfate-reducing bacteria. Ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) absorbance and 3-dimensional excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra were measured over a five weeks anaerobic dark incubation period. Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) of FDOM determined components that increased significantly during dark and anaerobic incubation matching three components previously considered of terrestrially-derived or humic-like origin published in the OpenFluor database. The observed FDOM increase was strongly correlated (R2‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.96) with the reduction of sulfate. These results show a direct experimental link between sulfate reduction and FDOM production, which impacts our understanding of coastal FDOM sources and early sediment diagenesis. As 3D fluorescence techniques are commonly applied to diverse systems, these results provide increasing support that FDOM can have many diverse sources not consistently captured by common classifications such as ‚Äúhumic-like‚Äù fluorescence.},

	abstract = {The goals of this work were to study sedimentary organic matter (OM) composition and transformation since the end of the last deglaciation and to evaluate the influence of contrasting depositional conditions on these parameters. One station was located in the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary (LSLE) where the current bottom waters are hypoxic and receive terrigenous and marine OM. The other station, located in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL), has more oxygenated bottom waters and almost only marine OM inputs. Analyses included enantiomers of amino acids (L and D-AA) and muramic acid that provide different markers of OM alteration state and reactivity and of bacterial contribution to OM composition and diagenesis. The markers clearly indicated the increase in OM alteration state with depth in the sediments of the LSLE and the GSL. The steady decrease in AA yields with depth confirmed the preferential degradation of AA compared to the rest of the OM. The OM in the surface sediment of the LSLE was less altered than that of the GSL and was enriched in bacterial biomass as indicated by much higher muramic acid yields. Results indicated that an important degradation of particulate organic matter occurs in the water column in the GSL, while it takes place mostly in the sediments in the LSLE. The presence of heterogeneous OM and hypoxic conditions in the LSLE likely reduce OM degradation rate in its deep water layer. However, the zone near the water-sediment interface is responsible for large variations in AA composition at both locations. A relatively new redox index, based on AA composition, was tested and appeared robust. This study highlights the importance of ambient conditions in determining the fate of OM and in the biogeochemical cycles of vital elements.},

	abstract = {Aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an essential role in biogeochemical cycling and transport of organic matter throughout the hydrological continuum. To characterise microbially-derived organic matter (OM) from common environmental microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy was employed. This work shows that bacterial organisms can produce fluorescent organic matter (FOM) in situ and, furthermore, that the production of FOM differs at a bacterial species level. This production can be attributed to structural biological compounds, specific functional proteins (e.g. pyoverdine production by P.¬†aeruginosa), and/or metabolic by-products. Bacterial growth curve data demonstrates that the production of FOM is fundamentally related to microbial metabolism. For example, the majority of Peak T fluorescence ({\textgreater} 75\%) is shown to be intracellular in origin, as a result of the building of proteins for growth and metabolism. This underpins the use of Peak T as a measure of microbial activity, as opposed to bacterial enumeration as has been previously suggested. This study shows that different bacterial species produce a range of FOM that has historically been attributed to high molecular weight allochthonous material or the degradation of terrestrial FOM. We provide definitive evidence that, in fact, it can be produced by microbes within a model system (autochthonous), providing new insights into the possible origin of allochthonous and autochthonous organic material present in aquatic systems.},

	abstract = {Karst areas are widespread landforms present on all continents, formed by the dissolution of carbonate or evaporite host rock. Little is known about the composition and nature of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as it moves through karst systems, although karst DOM has been recognized as important for a range of natural processes. Microbial communities living in karst systems are some of the most diverse and intriguing on the planet, and their metabolism and life cycle can give clues related to the development of a host of different life forms. Karst areas are also of interest due to their mostly subterranean hydrology, and the repercussions of these processes on local carbon cycles. We illustrate some of the processes acting on DOM in karst waters through the analysis of soil, drip and cave pool waters at the tropical site of Yok Balum Cave, in southern Belize. Water samples were analyzed using ultra-high resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS), a technique that enables the resolution of single molecular formulae within a DOM spectrum. We perform multivariate statistics to detect trends in the data and identify provenance of detected molecular components. In addition to karst waters, four aliquots of a powdered stalagmite sample from the same cave system are analyzed. Our results show a clear gradient between the soil and the cave system. We hypothesize that both sorption on mineral surfaces and microbial reworking are responsible for the observed trend in DOM composition. The stalagmite extracts show an anomalous DOM pattern, which may be due to a variety of factors, including microbial activity on the stalagmite surface and different affinities of compounds to incorporation in the carbonate. The goal of this study was to follow the molecular transformations of DOM on its journey from the surface to the cave, and to provide a molecular basis for the establishment of stalagmite DOM proxies in karst systems.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents a major reservoir of carbon in the oceans. Environmental stressors such as ocean acidification (OA) potentially affect DOM production and degradation processes, e.g. phytoplankton exudation or microbial uptake and biotransformation of molecules. Resulting changes in carbon storage capacity of the ocean, thus, may cause feedbacks on the global carbon cycle. Previous experiments studying OA effects on the DOM pool under natural conditions, however, were mostly conducted in temperate and coastal eutrophic areas. Here, we report on OA effects on the existing and newly produced DOM pool during an experiment in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean at the Canary Islands during an (1) oligotrophic phase and (2) after simulated deep water upwelling. The last is a frequently occurring event in this region controlling nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics. We manipulated nine large-scale mesocosms with a gradient of pCO2 ranging from {\textasciitilde}350 up to {\textasciitilde}1030 ¬µatm and monitored the DOM molecular composition using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry via Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). An increase of 37 ¬µmol L-1 DOC was observed in all mesocosms during a phytoplankton bloom induced by simulated upwelling. Indications for enhanced DOC accumulation under elevated CO2 became apparent during a phase of nutrient recycling towards the end of the experiment. The production of DOM was reflected in changes of the molecular DOM composition. Out of the 7,212 molecular formulae, which were detected throughout the experiment, {\textasciitilde}50\% correlated significantly in mass spectrometric signal intensity with cumulative bacterial protein production and are likely a product of microbial transformation. However, no differences in the produced compounds were found with respect to CO2 levels. Comparing the results of this experiment with a comparable OA experiment in the Swedish Gullmar Fjord, reveals similar succession patterns for individual compound pools during a phytoplankton bloom and subsequent accumulation of these compounds were observed. The similar behavior of DOM production and biotransformation during and following a phytoplankton bloom irrespective of plankton community composition and CO2 treatment provides novel insights into general dynamics of the marine DOM pool.},

	abstract = {Semi-labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) accumulates in surface waters of the oligotrophic ocean gyres and turns over on seasonal to annual timescales. This reservoir of DOM represents an important source of carbon, energy, and nutrients to marine microbial communities but the identity of the microorganisms and the biochemical pathways underlying the cycling of DOM remain largely uncharacterized. In this study we describe bacteria isolated from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) near Hawaii that are able to degrade phosphonates associated with high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMWDOM), which represents a large fraction of semi-labile DOM. We amended dilution-to-extinction cultures with HMWDOM collected from NPSG surface waters and with purified HMWDOM enriched with polysaccharides bearing alkylphosphonate esters. The HMWDOM-amended cultures were enriched in Roseobacter isolates closely related to Sulfitobacter and close relatives of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria of the Oceanospirillaceae family, many of which encoded phosphonate degradation pathways. Sulfitobacter cultures encoding C-P lyase were able to catabolize methylphosphonate and 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate, as well as the esters of these phosphonates found in native HMWDOM polysaccharides to acquire phosphorus while producing methane and ethylene, respectively. Conversely, growth of these isolates on HMWDOM polysaccharides as source of carbon did not support robust increases in cell yields, suggesting that the constituent carbohydrates in HMWDOM were not readily available to these individual isolates. We postulate that the complete remineralization of HMWDOM polysaccharides requires more complex microbial inter-species interactions. The degradation of phosphonate esters and other common substitutions in marine polysaccharides may be key steps in the turnover of marine DOM.},

The relative contributions of phytoplankton, colored dissolved organic matter (cdom) and detritus to light absorption highlight the importance of phytoplankton, but cdom contribution is often important in the blue range of the spectra despite its roughly constant values at 443 nm along the three orders of magnitude of total chlorophyll-a concentration, [TChl a], (0.019 to 2.91 mg m‚àí3) observed in the upper 100 m. The particulate backscattering coefficient, bbp(Œª), was remarkably low if compared to other oceanic waters, but agrees with previous studies in the Southern Ocean. Even with very low absorption, detritus was the component better correlated with particulate backscattering in the Antarctic Peninsula, while phytoplankton cells (dominant in the particles pool) mostly covaried with particulate scattering. Particulate backscattering ratios (bbp(Œª) divided by the particulate scattering coefficient, bp(Œª)) were also below values observed in other oceanic waters. The spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient, Kd(Œª), was highly correlated to [TChl a] (R2=0.90 at 443 nm) and showed no dependence on bbp(Œª). Indeed, Kd(443) and non-water absorption coefficients at 443 nm were related by a 1 to 1 dependence. The shape of the spectral remote sensing reflectance varied little responding mainly to variability in [TChl a], while [TChl a] vs. maximum band ratios dependence deviated from global trends in a very similar fashion as in other studies of the Southern Ocean, likely due to very low bbp(Œª).},

In this study, we examined fluorescence properties and the molecular composition of the alkaline-extractable organic matter (AEOM) of sediments in a coastal lake (Lake Sihwa) and its surrounding creeks (rural, urban, wetland, and industrial areas). Five fluorescence-based indices and 20 molecular parameters were selected from fluorescence spectroscopy and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), respectively, and utilized to discriminate the AEOM among five different sources as well as the chemical composition of hydrophobic acid (HoA) and hydrophilic (Hi) fractions. Ordination based on Bray‚ÄìCurtis dissimilarity matrices showed that the fluorescence-based indices distinguished among urban, lake, and the three other sources, while the molecular parameters from FT-ICR-MS performed better in discriminating among the sources of rural, wetland, and industrial areas. Irrespective of the sources, the two different chemical fractions were statistically distinguished by their relative distributions of the UVA-humic-like fluorescent component and the carbohydrate molecular group. However, a rigorous test based on percent dissimilarities indicated no superior capability of either of the two tools in discriminating the sources or their two chemical fractions, which might be attributed to the inherent structural heterogeneity of SeOM and the limited analytical window of FT-ICR-MS for relatively large-sized molecules.},

Since 2004, we have discerned an increase in the smallest algae and bacteria along with a concomitant decrease in somewhat larger algae. If this trend toward a community of smaller cells is sustained, it may lead to reduced biological production at higher trophic levels.

This study investigated the influence of specific sulfur-containing organic compounds and naturally occurring DOM on the accumulation of MeHg in a marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. Initial uptake rate constants and volume concentration factors (VCFs) of MeHg were calculated to evaluate MeHg enrichment in algal cells in the presence of a range of organic compound concentrations. At environmentally realistic and higher concentrations, the addition of glycine and methionine had no effect on algal MeHg uptake, but thiol-containing compounds such as cysteine and thioglycolic acid reduced MeHg accumulation in algal cells at high added concentrations ({\textgreater}100 times higher than naturally occurring concentrations). However, environmentally realistic concentrations of glutathione, another thiol-containing compound as low as 10nM, resulted in a decline of {\textasciitilde}30\% in VCFs, suggesting its possible importance in natural waters. Humic acid additions of 0.1 and 0.5mg C/L also reduced MeHg VCFs by {\textasciitilde}15\% and {\textasciitilde}25\%, respectively. The bioaccumulation of MeHg for T. pseudonana in coastal waters with varying levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was inversely correlated with bulk DOC concentrations. Generally, naturally occurring DOM, particularly certain thiol-containing compounds, can reduce MeHg uptake by phytoplankton.},

	abstract = {Bacterial consumption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) drives much of the movement of carbon through the oceanic food web and the global carbon cycle. Understanding complex interactions between bacteria and marine DOM remains an important challenge. We tested the hypothesis that bacterial growth and community succession would respond differently to DOM additions due to seasonal changes in phytoplankton abundance in the environment. Four mesocosm experiments were conducted that spanned the spring transitional period (August-December 2013) in surface waters of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Each mesocosm consisted of nearshore surface seawater (50 L) incubated in the laboratory for 10 days. The addition of DOM, in the form of cell-free exudates extracted from Thalassiosira weissflogii diatom cultures led to changes in bacterial abundance, production, and community composition. The timing of each mesocosm experiment (i.e. late winter versus late spring) influenced the magnitude and direction of bacterial changes. For example, the same DOM treatment applied at different times during the season resulted in different levels of bacterial production and different bacterial community composition. There was a mid-season shift from Collwelliaceae to Polaribacter having the greatest relative abundance after incubation. This shift corresponded to a modest but significant increase in the initial relative abundance of Polaribacter in the nearshore seawater used to set up experiments. This finding supports a new hypothesis that starting community composition, through priority effects, influenced the trajectory of community succession in response to DOM addition. As strong inter-annual variability and long-term climate change may shift the timing of WAP phytoplankton blooms, and the corresponding production of DOM exudates, this study suggests a mechanism by which different seasonal successional patterns in bacterial communities could occur.},

In particular, seasonal changes in environmental light regimes have been shown to strongly influence krill metabolism, representing control signals for seasonal regulation of physiology of this key Southern Ocean species. Here, we report the identification of a cryptochrome gene, a cardinal component of the clockwork machinery in several organisms. EsCRY appears to be an ortholog of mammalian-like CRYs and clusters with the insect CRY2 subfamily. EsCRY has the canonical bipartite CRY structure, with a conserved N-terminal domain and a highly divergent C-terminus, that bears several binding motifs, some of them shared with insect CRY2 and others peculiar for EsCRY. We have evaluated the temporal expression of Escry both at mRNA and protein levels in individuals harvested from the Ross Sea at different times throughout the 24 h cycle during the Antarctic summer. We observed a daily fluctuation in abundance for Escry mRNA in the head, with high levels around 06:00 h, which is not mirrored by a cycle in the corresponding protein. Our findings represent a first step toward establishing the presence of an endogenous circadian time-keeping mechanism that might allow this organism to synchronize its physiology and behavior to the Antarctic light regimes.},

The wide spatial coverage over a short period of time achieved during this study revealed longitudinal variability in organic matter characteristics reflecting productivity at the Black Sea surface. Particulate organic matter was dominantly autochthonous in the central Black Sea. Allochthonous influence of river discharge was only traced on the northwestern shelf by high concentrations but low freshness of particulate organic matter. Compared to the NW shelf break and central Black Sea, primary production was high near the NE shelf break, likely fueled by input from the Azov Sea. Vertical patterns were similar throughout the deep Black Sea and appeared to also be governed by in situ processes rather than reflect variability in the surface water. As concentrations of organic matter decreased with depth, its elemental and isotopic composition indicated chemoautotrophic production at the oxic-anoxic interface and organic matter degradation in the benthic boundary layer. Though profiles of dissolved organic carbon indicated a minor source in anoxic deep water, likely linked to chemosynthesis and reflux from sediments, a negative deviation of concentrations from a conservative mixing line between two endmembers suggested net removal of labile dissolved organic carbon.},

We investigated long-term trends of maximum temperature of Atlantic Water (AW) in two west Spitsbergen fjords. The data set is composed of more than 400 oceanographic stations for Isfjorden and Gr√∏nfjorden (78.1¬∞N), spanning from 1876 to 2009. Trends throughout the last century (1912‚Äì2009) indicate an increase of 1.9¬∞C and 2.1¬∞C in the maximum temperature during autumn for Isfjorden and Gr√∏nfjorden, respectively. A recent warming event in the beginning of the 21st century is found to be more than 1¬∞C higher than the second warmest period in the time series. Mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) data from ERA-40 and ERA-Interim data sets produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and mean temperature in the core of the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) at the S√∏rkapp Section along 76.3¬∞N were used to explain the variability of the maximum temperature. A correlation analysis confirmed previous findings, showing that variability in the oceanography of the fjords can be explained mainly by two external factors: AW temperature variability in the WSC and regional patterns of the wind stress field. To take both processes into consideration, a multiple regression model accounting for temperature in the WSC core and MSLP over the area was developed. The predicted time series shows a reasonable agreement with observed maxima temperature in Isfjorden for the period 1977‚Äì2009 (N=24), with a statistically significant multiple correlation coefficient of 0.60 (R 2=0.36) at P{\textless}0.05.},

In West Spitsbergen, Atlantic Water from the West Spitsbergen Current exchanges with the seasonally ice-covered waters of the coast and fjords causing a major annual shift in hydrographic conditions. The extent to which Atlantic Water dominates the fjord systems shows significant interannual variability. Hydrographic sections taken between 1999 and 2005 from Isfjorden and the adjacent shelf have been analyzed to identify the causes of the variability in Atlantic Water occupation of the fjord system. By treating the fjord system as a coastal polynya and running a polynya model to quantify the salt release each winter, we conclude that the critical parameter controlling fjord‚Äìshelf exchange is the density difference between the fjord water masses and the Atlantic Water.

At the two stations studied, the photosynthetic biomass was dominated by protists {\textgreater} 3¬µm and was concentrated in the upper 70-80 m, above the thermocline and halocline. Hierarchical cluster analyses as well as ordination analyses showed a distinct clustering of the mi-crobial eukaryote communities according to a combination of watermass and local environmental characteristics. While samples collected in the surface mixed layer differed distinctly between the two sites, the deeper communities collected in Atlantic Water were fairly similar despite being geographically distant. The differentiation of the microbial eukaryote communities of the upper mixed water was probably driven by local development and advection, while the lack of such differentiation in the communities of Atlantic Water reflects the homogenizing effect of water currents on microbial communities.},

The method was tested using samples from below the chemocline of an anoxic Danish fjord. The simple protocol yielded RNA and DNA of a purity suitable for amplification by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR, respectively. We constructed an rRNA-derived and an rDNA-derived clone library to assess the composition of the microeukaryote assemblage under study and to identify physiologically active constituents of the community. We retrieved nearly 600 protistan target clones, which grouped into 84 different phylotypes (98\% sequence similarity). Of these phylotypes, 27\% occurred in both libraries, 25\% exclusively in the rRNA library, and 48\% exclusively in the rDNA library. Both libraries revealed good correspondence of the general community composition in terms of higher taxonomic ranks. They were dominated by anaerobic ciliates and heterotrophic stramenopile flagellates thriving below the fjord's chemocline. The high abundance of these bacterivore organisms points out their role as a major trophic link in anoxic marine systems. A comparison of the two libraries identified phototrophic dinoflagellates, "uncultured marine alveolates group I," and different parasites, which were exclusively detected with the rDNA-derived library, as nonindigenous members of the anoxic microeukaryote community under study.},

	abstract = {Mixotrophy is a valuable functional trait used by microbes when environmental conditions vary broadly or resources are limited. In the sunlit waters of the ocean, photoheterotrophy, a form of mixotrophy, is often mediated by proteorhodopsin (PR), a seven helices transmembrane protein binding the retinal chromophore. Altogether, they allow bacteria to capture photic energy for sensory and proton gradient formation cell functions. The seasonal occurrence and diversity of the gene coding for PR in cold oligotrophic polar oceans is not known and PR expression has not yet been reported. Here we show that PR is widely distributed among bacterial taxa, and that PR expression decreased markedly during the winter months in the Arctic Ocean. Gammaproteobacteria-like PR sequences were always dominant. However, within the second most common affiliation, there was a transition from Flavobacteria-like PR in early winter to Alphaproteobacteria-like PR in late winter. The phylogenetic shifts followed carbon dynamics, where patterns in expression were consistent with community succession, as identified by DNA community fingerprinting. Although genes for PR were always present, the trend in decreasing transcripts from January to February suggested reduced functional utility of PR during winter. Under winter darkness, sustained expression suggests that PR may continue to be useful for non-ATP forming functions, such as environmental sensing or small solute transport. The persistence of PR expression in winter among some bacterial groups may offer a competitive advantage, where its multifunctionality enhances microbial survival under harsh polar conditions.},

	abstract = {Molecular size plays an important role in dissolved organic matter (DOM) biogeochemistry, but its relationship with the fluorescent fraction of DOM (FDOM) remains poorly resolved. Here high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was coupled to fluorescence emission-excitation (EEM) spectroscopy in full spectral (60 emission and 34 excitation wavelengths) and chromatographic resolution ({\textless} 1Hz), to enable the mathematical decomposition of fluorescence on an individual sample basis by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The approach allowed cross-system comparisons of molecular size distributions for individual fluorescence components obtained from independent datasets. Spectra extracted from allochthonous DOM were highly similar. Allochthonous and autochthonous DOM shared some spectra, but included unique components. In agreement with the supramolecular assembly hypothesis, molecular size distributions of the fluorescence fractions were broad and chromatographically unresolved, possibly representing reoccurring fluorophores forming non-covalently bound assemblies of varying molecular size. Samples shared underlying fluorescence components that differed in their size distributions but not their spectral properties. Thus, in contrast to absorption measurements, bulk fluorescence is unlikely to reliably indicate the average molecular size of DOM. The one-sample approach enables robust and independent cross-site comparisons without large-scale sampling efforts and introduces new analytical opportunities for elucidating the origins and biogeochemical properties of FDOM.},

The majority of life in the Arctic is microbial and the consequences of climate-mediated changes on microbial marine food webs, which are responsible for biogeochemical cycling and support higher trophic levels, are unknown. We examined microbial communities over time by using high-throughput sequencing of microbial DNA collected between 2003 and 2010 from the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) layer of the Beaufort Sea (Canadian Arctic). We found that overall this layer has freshened and concentrations of nitrate, the limiting nutrient for photosynthetic production in Arctic seas, have decreased. We compared microbial communities from before and after the record September 2007 sea ice minimum and detected significant differences in communities from all three domains of life. In particular, there were significant changes in species composition of Eukarya, with ciliates becoming more common and heterotrophic marine stramenopiles (MASTs) accounting for a smaller proportion of sequences retrieved after 2007. Within the Archaea, Marine Group I Thaumarchaeota, which earlier represented up to 60\% of the Archaea sequences in this layer, have declined to {\textless}10\%. Bacterial communities overall were less diverse after 2007, with a significant decrease of the Bacteroidetes. These significant shifts suggest that the microbial food webs are sensitive to physical oceanographic changes such as those occurring in the Canadian Arctic over the past decade.},

Furthermore, we evaluate the potential of SNPs relative to frequently used genetic markers, such as microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences, and we discuss statistical power, analytical approaches, and technological improvements and limitations. Although ascertainment bias is a problem for some applications, SNPs can often generate equivalent statistical power whilst providing broader genome coverage and higher quality data than can either microsatellites or mtDNA, suggesting that SNPs could become an efficient and cost-effective genetic tool.},

Traditional ecological approaches underpin such advances, but would additionally benefit from recent developments in the sequence-based quantification of biodiversity from the fields of molecular ecology and genomics. By building on a long and rich history of molecular taxonomy and taking advantage of the new generation of DNA sequencing technologies, we are gaining previously impossible insights into alpha and beta diversity from all domains of life, irrespective of body size. While a number of complementary reviews are available in specialist journals, our aim here is to succinctly describe the different technologies available within the omics toolbox and showcase the opportunities available to contemporary ecologists to advance our understanding of biodiversity and its potential roles in ecosystems.


* Starting in the field, we walk the reader through sampling and preservation of genomic material, including typical taxonomy marker genes used for species identification. Moving on to the laboratory, we cover nucleic acid extraction approaches and highlight the principal features of using marker gene assessment, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, single-cell genomics and targeted genome sequencing as complementary approaches to assess the taxonomic and functional characteristics of biodiversity. We additionally provide clear guidance on the forms of DNA found in the environmental samples (e.g. environmental vs. ancient DNA) and highlight a selection of case studies, including the investigation of trophic relationships/food webs. Given the maturity of sequence-based identification of prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes, more exposure is given to macrobial communities. We additionally illustrate current approaches to genomic data analysis and highlight the exciting prospects of the publicly available data underpinning published sequence-based studies.


* Given that ecology ‚Äòhas to count‚Äô, we identify the impact that molecular genetic analyses have had on stakeholders and end-users and predict future developments for the fields of biomonitoring. Furthermore, we conclude by highlighting future opportunities in the field of systems ecology afforded by effective engagement between the fields of traditional and molecular ecology.},

Using the recently discovered dinoflagellate mRNA-specific spliced leader as a selective primer, we constructed cDNA libraries (e-cDNAs) from one marine and two freshwater plankton assemblages. Small-scale sequencing of the e-cDNAs revealed functionally diverse transcriptomes proven to be of dinoflagellate origin. A set of dinoflagellate common genes and transcripts of dominant dinoflagellate species were identified. Further analyses of the dataset prompted us to delve into the existing, largely unannotated dinoflagellate EST datasets (DinoEST). Consequently, all four nucleosome core histones, two histone modification proteins, and a nucleosome assembly protein were detected, clearly indicating the presence of nucleosome-like machinery long thought not to exist in dinoflagellates. The isolation of rhodopsin from taxonomically and ecotypically diverse dinoflagellates and its structural similarity and phylogenetic affinity to xanthorhodopsin suggest a common genetic potential in dinoflagellates to use solar energy nonphotosynthetically. Furthermore, we found 55 cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (RPs) from the e-cDNAs and 24 more from DinoEST, showing that the dinoflagellate phylum possesses all 79 eukaryotic RPs. Our results suggest that a sophisticated eukaryotic molecular machine operates in dinoflagellates that likely encodes many more unsuspected physiological capabilities and, meanwhile, demonstrate that unique spliced leaders are useful for profiling lineage-specific microbial transcriptomes in situ.},

	abstract = {Kongsfjorden is a glacial fjord in the Arctic (Svalbard) that is influenced by both Atlantic and Arctic water masses and harbours a mixture of boreal and Arctic flora and fauna. Inputs from large tidal glaciers create steep environmental gradients in sedimentation and salinity along the length of this fjord. The glacial inputs cause reduced biomass and diversity in the benthic community in the inner fjord. Zooplankton suffers direct mortality from the glacial outflow and primary production is reduced because of limited light levels in the turbid, mixed inner waters. The magnitude of the glacial effects diminishes towards the outer fjord. Kongsfjorden is an important feeding ground for marine mammals and seabirds. Even though the fjord contains some boreal fauna, the prey consumed by upper trophic levels is mainly Arctic organisms. Marine mammals constitute the largest top-predator biomass, but seabirds have the largest energy intake and also export nutrients and energy out of the marine environment. Kongsfjorden has received a lot of research attention in the recent past. The current interest in the fjord is primarily based on the fact that Kongsfjorden is particularly suitable as a site for exploring the impacts of possible climate changes, with Atlantic water influx and melting of tidal glaciers both being linked to climate variability. The pelagic ecosystem is likely to be most sensitive to the Atlantic versus Arctic influence, whereas the benthic ecosystem is more affected by long-term changes in hydrography as well as changes in glacial runoff and sedimentation. Kongsfjorden will be an important Arctic monitoring site over the coming decades and a review of the current knowledge, and a gap analysis, are therefore warranted. Important knowledge gaps include a lack of quantitative data on production, abundance of key prey species, and the role of advection on the biological communities in the fjord.},

Microsatellites have emerged as the most popular and versatile marker type for ecological applications. The rise of commercial services that can isolate microsatellites for new study species and genotype samples at reasonable prices presents ecologists with the unprecedented ability to employ genetic approaches without heavy investment in specialized equipment. Nevertheless, the lack of accessible, synthesized information on the practicalities and pitfalls of using genetic tools impedes ecologists‚Äô ability to make informed decisions on using molecular approaches and creates the risk that some will use microsatellites without understanding the steps needed to evaluate the quality of a genetic data set. The first goal of this synthesis is to provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of microsatellite markers and the risks, cost and time requirements of isolating and using microsatellites with the aid of commercial services. The second goal is to encourage the use and consistent reporting of thorough marker screening to ensure high quality data. To that end, we present a multistep screening process to evaluate candidate loci for inclusion in a genetic study that is broadly targeted to both novice and experienced geneticists alike.},

In this study, we mapped out one of the smallest and globally most widespread primary producers, the picocyanobacterium Synechococcus, within the Atlantic inflow to the Arctic Ocean. In contrast to the general understanding that Synechococcus is almost absent in polar oceans due to low temperatures, we encountered high abundances (up to 21,000 cells mL-1) at 79 ¬∞N, and documented their presence as far north as 82.5 ¬∞N. Covering an annual cycle in 2014, we found that during autumn and winter, Synechococcus was often more abundant than picoeukaryotes, which usually dominate the picophytoplankton communities in the Arctic. Synechococcus community composition shifted from a quite high genetic diversity during the spring bloom to a clear dominance of two specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in autumn and winter. We observed abundances higher than 1,000 cells mL-1 in water colder than 2 ¬∞C at seven distinct stations and size-fractionation experiments demonstrated a net growth of Synechococcus at 2 ¬∞C in the absence of nano-sized grazers at certain periods of the year. Phylogenetic analysis of petB sequences demonstrated that these high latitude Synechococcus group within the previously described cold-adapted clades I and IV, but also contributed to unveil novel genetic diversity, especially within clade I.},

There is reason for concern that species extinctions may out-pace discovery, especially in diverse and endangered marine habitats such as coral reefs. DNA barcodes (i.e., short DNA sequences for species recognition and discrimination) are useful tools to accelerate species-level analysis of marine biodiversity and to facilitate conservation efforts. This review focuses on the usual barcode region for metazoans: a approximately 648 base-pair region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Barcodes have also been used for population genetic and phylogeographic analysis, identification of prey in gut contents, detection of invasive species, forensics, and seafood safety. More controversially, barcodes have been used to delimit species boundaries, reveal cryptic species, and discover new species. Emerging frontiers are the use of barcodes for rapid and increasingly automated biodiversity assessment by high-throughput sequencing, including environmental barcoding and the use of barcodes to detect species for which formal identification or scientific naming may never be possible.},

Having accurate techniques for determining dietary ranges and components is critical for this endeavour. While visual analyses and early molecular approaches are highly labour intensive and often lack resolution, recent DNA-based approaches potentially provide more accurate methods for dietary studies. A suite of approaches have been used based on the identification of consumed species by characterization of DNA present in gut or faecal samples. In one approach, a standardized DNA region (DNA barcode) is PCR amplified, amplicons are sequenced and then compared to a reference database for identification. Initially, this involved sequencing clones from PCR products, and studies were limited in scale because of the costs and effort required. The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has made this approach much more powerful, by allowing the direct characterization of dozens of samples with several thousand sequences per PCR product, and has the potential to reveal many consumed species simultaneously (DNA metabarcoding). Continual improvement of NGS technologies, on-going decreases in costs and current massive expansion of reference databases make this approach promising. Here we review the power and pitfalls of NGS diet methods. We present the critical factors to take into account when choosing or designing a suitable barcode. Then, we consider both technical and analytical aspects of NGS diet studies. Finally, we discuss the validation of data accuracy including the viability of producing quantitative data.},

	abstract = {Sea ice loss in the Arctic Ocean has up to now been strongest during summer. In contrast, the sea ice concentration north of Svalbard has experienced a larger decline during winter since 1979. The trend in winter ice area loss is close to 10\% per decade, and concurrent with a 0.3¬∞C per decade warming of the Atlantic Water entering the Arctic Ocean in this region. Simultaneously, there has been a 2¬∞C per decade warming of winter mean surface air temperature north of Svalbard, which is 20‚Äì45\% higher than observations on the west coast. Generally, the ice edge north of Svalbard has retreated towards the northeast, along the Atlantic Water pathway. By making reasonable assumptions about the Atlantic Water volume and associated heat transport, we show that the extra oceanic heat brought into the region is likely to have caused the sea ice loss. The reduced sea ice cover leads to more oceanic heat transferred to the atmosphere, suggesting that part of the atmospheric warming is driven by larger open water area. In contrast to significant trends in sea ice concentration, Atlantic Water temperature and air temperature, there is no significant temporal trend in the local winds. Thus, winds have not caused the long-term warming or sea ice loss. However, the dominant winds transport sea ice from the Arctic Ocean into the region north of Svalbard, and the local wind has influence on the year-to-year variability of the ice concentration, which correlates with surface air temperatures, ocean temperatures, as well as the local wind.},

Content: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement.
Summary: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.},

In contrast, a single ecotype of the prasinophyte Micromonas is frequently the most abundant photosynthetic taxon reported in the Arctic from summer through autumn. However, seasonal dynamics of prasinophytes outside of this period are little known. To address this, we analyzed high-throughput V4 18S rRNA amplicon data collected from November to July in the Amundsen Gulf Region, Beaufort Sea, Arctic. Surprisingly during polar sunset in November and December, we found a high proportion of reads from both DNA and RNA belonging to another prasinophyte, Bathycoccus. We then analyzed a metagenome from a December sample and the resulting Bathycoccus metagenome assembled genome (MAG) covered {\textasciitilde}90\% of the Bathycoccus Ban7 reference genome. In contrast, only {\textasciitilde}20\% of a reference Micromonas genome was found in the metagenome. Our phylogenetic analysis of marker genes placed the Arctic Bathycoccus in the B1 coastal clade. In addition, substitution rates of 129 coding DNA sequences were {\textasciitilde}1.6\% divergent between the Arctic MAG and coastal Chilean upwelling MAGs and 17.3\% between it and a South East Atlantic open ocean MAG in the B2 Clade. The metagenomic analysis also revealed a winter viral community highly skewed toward viruses targeting Micromonas, with a much lower diversity of viruses targeting Bathycoccus. Overall a combination of Micromonas being relatively less able to maintain activity under dark winter conditions and viral suppression of Micromonas may have contributed to the success of Bathycoccus in the Amundsen Gulf during winter.},

The community composition of microbial eukaryotes (size, 0.45 to 10 Œºm) from a depth of 25 m was determined using 454 sequencing of the 18S V4 region amplified from both DNA and RNA. The compositional changes throughout the year were assessed in relation to in situ fjord environmental conditions. Size fractionation analyses of chlorophyll a showed that the photosynthetic biomass was dominated by small cells ({\textless}10 Œºm) most of the year but that larger cells dominated during the spring and summer. The winter and early-spring communities were more diverse than the spring and summer/autumn communities. Dinophyceae were predominant throughout the year. The Arctic Micromonas ecotype was abundant mostly in the early-bloom and fall periods, whereas heterotrophs, such as marine stramenopiles (MASTs), Picozoa, and the parasitoid marine alveolates (MALVs), displayed higher relative abundance in the winter than in other seasons. Our results emphasize the extreme seasonality of Arctic microbial eukaryotic communities driven by the light regime and nutrient availability but point to the necessity of a thorough knowledge of hydrography for full understanding of their succession and variability.},

	abstract = {Several recent lines of evidence indicate that the polar night is key to understanding Arctic marine ecosystems. First, the polar night is not a period void of biological activity even though primary production is close to zero, but is rather characterized by a number of processes and interactions yet to be fully understood, including unanticipated high levels of feeding and reproduction in a wide range of taxa and habitats. Second, as more knowledge emerges, it is evident that a coupled physical and biological perspective of the ecosystem will redefine seasonality beyond the ‚Äúcalendar perspective‚Äù. Third, it appears that many organisms may exhibit endogenous rhythms that trigger fitness-maximizing activities in the absence of light-based cues. Indeed a common adaptation appears to be the ability to utilize the dark season for reproduction. This and other processes are most likely adaptations to current environmental conditions and community and trophic structures of the ecosystem, and may have implications for how Arctic ecosystems can change under continued climatic warming.},

Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we characterized the microbial diversity of terrestrial and lacustrine biofilms from the Arctic, Antarctic and temperate regions. Our analyses suggest that bacterial community compositions at the poles are more similar to each other than they are to geographically closer temperate habitats, with 32 \% of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs) co-occurring in both polar regions. While specific microbial taxa were confined to distinct regions, representing potentially endemic populations, the percentage of cosmopolitan taxa was higher in Arctic (43 \%) than in Antarctic samples (36 \%). The overlap in polar microbial OTUs may be explained by natural or anthropogenically-mediated dispersal in combination with environmental filtering. Current and future changing environmental conditions may enhance microbial invasion, establishment of cosmopolitan genotypes and loss of endemic taxa.},

Typically, more than 99\% of microorganisms from natural ecosystems cannot be cultured under laboratory conditions. Therefore, there is a demand for culture-independent approaches for identification and characterization of such microorganisms and uncovering their ecological roles in the biosphere. Metagenomics is culture-independent, sequencing-based and/or function-based analysis of the collective genome of a microbial community, which enables collection of essential information about community structure and genetic and metabolic potential of the members, thus providing insights into the biology of these microorganisms. Another culture-independent method is single-cell genomics, which obtains information about microbial population based on the isolation and genome sequencing of a single cell. This chapter presents an overview of the history of metagenomics and describes the main approaches used for analysis of microbial communities, including the synergy between metagenomics and single-cell genomics, and outlines further directions in this field.},

The results revealed increasing concentrations of PP and POC in exposed samples with increasing exposure time (cumulative irradiation energy). At the end of experiments, PP concentrations were from 5 to 20¬†Œºg¬†L‚àí1 in the exposed samples. Based on an enumeration of bacteria in the samples, we estimated the contribution of biotic and abiotic processes to the PP production. The abiotic PP formation ranged from 56 to 83\% and 50‚Äì95\% of the total PP in the exposed and control samples, respectively. The remainder was assumed to be bacterial P uptake. Despite the overlapping intervals, biotic and abiotic PP productions were usually higher in exposed samples than in controls. The PP and POC production was affected by the properties of DOM, such as its humic content and freshness index. We hypothesize that the observed immobilization of dissolved P in bacteria and on photochemically-formed particles can contribute to a P limitation of primary production in headwater environments that receive waters rich in soil DOM.},

Sediments from three areas (two cold seeps with contrasting hydrocarbon composition and a site outside any area of active seepage) of the Gulf of Mexico were investigated and compared. Consistent with the existence of a seep microbiome, a distinct microbial community was observed in seep areas compared to sediment from outside areas of active seepage. The microbial community from sediments without any influence from hydrocarbon seepage was characterized by Planctomycetes and the metabolic potential was consistent with detrital marine snow degradation. By contrast, in seep samples with methane as the principal hydrocarbon, methane oxidation by abundant members of ANME-1 was likely the predominant process. Seep samples characterized by fluids containing both methane and complex hydrocarbons, were characterized by abundant Chloroflexi (Anaerolinaceae) and deltaproteobacterial lineages and exhibited potential for complex hydrocarbon degradation. These different metabolic capacities suggested that microorganisms in cold seeps can potentially rely on other processes beyond methane oxidation and that the hydrocarbon composition of the seep fluids may be a critical factor structuring the seafloor microbial community composition and function.},

Field research on the cold seeps of the Mukhrina River (Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous okrug, Russia) revealed methane fluxes from these structures to be orders of magnitude higher than from equivalent areas of the mid-taiga bogs. Microbial communities developing around the seeps were formed under conditions of high methane concentrations, low temperatures (3‚Äì5¬∞C), and near-neutral pH. Molecular identification of methane-oxidizing bacteria from this community by analysis of the pmoA gene encoding particulate methane monooxygenase revealed both type I and type II methanotrophs (classes Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, respectively), with prevalence of type I methanotrophs. Among the latter, microorganisms related to Methylobacter psychrophilus and Methylobacter tundripaludum, Crenothrix polyspora (a stagnant water dweller), and a number of methanotrophs belonging to unknown taxa were detected. Growth characteristics of two methanotrophic isolates were determined. Methylobacter sp. CMS7 exhibited active growth at 4‚Äì10¬∞C, while Methylocystis sp. SB12 grew better at 20¬∞C. Experimental results confirmed the major role of methanotrophic gammaproteobacteria in controlling the methane emission from cold river seeps.},

With methane being an important greenhouse gas, the predicted warming of the Arctic may provide a positive feedback. However, the amount of methane released to the atmosphere may be controlled by the activity of methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) living in the oxic surface layer of wetlands. Previously, methanotrophs have been isolated and identified by genetic profiling in High Arctic wetlands showing the presence of only a few genotypes. Two isolates from Solvatnet (Ny-√Ölesund, Spitsbergen; 79¬∞N) are available: Methylobacter tundripaludum (type I) and Methylocystis rosea (type II), raising the question whether the low diversity is a cultivation effect. We have revisited Solvatnet applying stable isotope probing (SIP) with 13C-labelled methane. 16S rRNA profiling revealed active type I methanotrophs including M. tundripaludum, while no active type II methanotrophs were identified. These results indicate that the extant M. tundripaludum is an active methane oxidizer at its locus typicus; furthermore, Methylobacter seems to be the dominant active genus. Diversity of methanotrophs was low as compared, e.g. to wetland rice fields in the Mediterranean. This low diversity suggests a high vulnerability of Arctic methanotroph communities, which deserves more attention.},

Methanotrophic bacteria were detected by PCR and FISH in only 8 hot springs. The highest numbers of copies of the pmoA gene (molecular marker of methanotrophy) (2.8 √ó 107 and 1.1 √ó 107 copies/mL sediment) were detected in the Kul‚Äôturnyi and Kvadrat springs; however, in other springs, the numbers of the pmoA gene copies were significantly lower (5.4 √ó 103‚Äì2.8 √ó 106 copies/mL sediment). By using the FISH method, only type I methanotrophs were detected in these springs, with their percentage ranging from 0.3 to 20.5\% of the total number of eubacteria. PCR-DGGE analysis of the pmoA gene showed that the diversity of methanotrophs was extremely low (no more that two components). Analysis of the deduced PmoA amino acid sequences demonstrated that methanotrophic bacteria of the genus Methylothermus, closely related to representatives of two valid species, widely occurred in the thermal springs near Lake Fumarol‚Äônoe. Other bacteria differing considerably from the detected Methylothermus species were detected as well. In the springs with low pH values (2.6‚Äì3.8), methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria most closely related to the genera Methylomonas and Methylobacter were detected for the first time.},

	abstract = {Sustained whole-lake additions of 13C-enriched dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), intended to increase experimentally the Œ¥13C of DIC in the epilimnion of a small lake with high dissolved organic carbon (DOC), were made during three seasonal periods (spring, summer, and autumn). Coupled with carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of zooplankton and several of their putative food sources, these additions were used to investigate seasonal changes in the relative contributions of different food sources to zooplankton diet in the lake. Four main potential food sources were considered: phytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria (HB), methanotrophic bacteria (MOB), and green sulfur bacteria (GSB). Because the number of potential food sources exceeded the number of isotopes analyzed, a computer program (IsoSource) was used to estimate the range of possible contributions of the various food sources. During all three periods the added inorganic 13C quickly increased the epilimnetic DIC Œ¥13C by between 18‚Ä∞ and 21‚Ä∞ above the initial value of approximately ‚àí21‚Ä∞. This 13C enrichment of DIC was rapidly transmitted to the particulate organic matter (POM), which included photosynthetic phytoplankton. In spring and summer, Œ¥13C of both adult and juvenile Daphnia increased by ‚àº10‚Ä∞, indicating that Daphnia utilized autochthonous carbon. However, this 13C labeling of Daphnia was not so obvious during the autumn period, when their Œ¥13C generally decreased. According to the IsoSource model outputs based on both Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N values, Daphnia utilized all four potential food source types during spring, summer, and autumn, but in different proportions. The possible contribution of phytoplankton to Daphnia diet was substantial (25‚Äì71\%) in all seasons. The possible contributions of the bacterial food sources were more variable. The possible contribution of GSB was minor (0‚Äì20\%) at all times and negligible in autumn. The possible contribution of HB was higher but very variable. Methanotrophic bacteria always made a significant contribution to Daphnia diet and were likely the single most important food source in autumn. Since both HB and MOB in this high-DOC lake probably depend largely on allochthonous organic carbon, our results highlight the seasonal variability in the potential importance of ecosystem subsidies in lake food webs.},

Cells of strain WF1T were elongated cocci, approximately 1.5 ¬µm in diameter, and occurred singly, in pairs and in clumps. The cell wall was Gram-negative, and stacked intracytoplasmic membranes and storage granules were evident. The genomic DNA G+C content of WF1T was 40.5 mol\%, significantly lower than that of currently described cultivars, and the major fatty acids were 16‚Ää:‚Ää0, 16‚Ää:‚Ää1œâ9c, 16‚Ää:‚Ää1œâ9t, 16‚Ää:‚Ää1œâ8c and 16‚Ää:‚Ää2œâ9,14.

Phytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria, green sulphur bacteria and methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) were all present in the water column of the lake, and previous studies have indicated that vertically migrating Daphnia can exploit all these potential food sources. 2.‚ÄÇFor adult Daphnia, although there was some correspondence between the PLFA profile of Daphnia and the concurrent seston PLFA profile, strongest correlations were between the Daphnia PLFA profile and those of potential food sources determined 7¬†days earlier. This interval presumably reflects the time it takes for adult Daphnia to turn over their fatty acid pool. 3.‚ÄÇA correlation between the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the epi- and metalimnion and measured primary production indicated that, within the total PLFA fraction, PUFAs can be useful biomarkers for phytoplankton in food-web studies. Algal PUFAs contributed appreciably to total PLFAs in adult Daphnia during spring and summer, but less so in autumn. 4.‚ÄÇ Daphnia in the lake actually reached their highest biomass in autumn, when methanotrophic activity was also highest, and the highest magnitude of MOB-specific PLFAs was recorded in both adult and juvenile Daphnia. A strong relationship existed between Œ¥13C values of Daphnia reported previously and the proportion of MOB-specific PLFAs in Daphnia. Autumnal mixing evidently stimulates bacterial oxidation of methane from the hypolimnion, and exploitation of the methanotrophic bacteria sustains a high Daphnia population late in the season. 5.‚ÄÇOur results show that the PLFA composition of freshwater zooplankton like Daphnia corresponds rather well to that of their in situ diet of phytoplankton and bacteria, with a lag period of around 1¬†week in the case of adult animals. The PLFA profile of seston revealed the dominant available food sources, and relating these to the Daphnia PLFA profile provided insights into seasonal changes in Daphnia diet.},

	abstract = {We have previously observed that methane supplied to lake sediment microbial communities as a substrate not only causes a response by bona fide methanotrophic bacteria, but also by non-methane-oxidizing bacteria, especially by members of the family Methylophilaceae. This result suggested that methane oxidation in this environment likely involves communities composed of different functional guilds, rather than a single type of microbe. To obtain further support for this concept and to obtain further insights into the factors that may define such partnerships, we carried out microcosm incubations with sediment samples from Lake Washington at five different oxygen tensions, while methane was supplied at the same concentration in each. Community composition was determined through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing after 10 and 16 weeks of incubation. We demonstrate that, in support of our prior observations, the methane-consuming communities were represented by two major types: the methanotrophs of the family Methylococcaceae and by non-methanotrophic methylotrophs of the family Methylophilaceae. However, different species persisted under different oxygen tensions. At high initial oxygen tensions (150 to 225 ¬µM) the major players were, respectively, species of the genera Methylosarcina and Methylophilus, while at low initial oxygen tensions (15 to 75 ¬µM) the major players were Methylobacter and Methylotenera. These data suggest that oxygen availability is at least one major factor determining specific partnerships in methane oxidation. The data also suggest that speciation within Methylococcaceae and Methylophilaceae may be driven by niche adaptation tailored toward specific placements within the oxygen gradient.},

Potential methane-oxidizing activity of peat sampled from lichen-dominated wetland sites was higher than that in the sites dominated by Sphagnum mosses. In peat from lichen-dominated sites, major bacterial groups identified by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes were the Acidobacteria (35.4‚Äì41.2\% of total 16S rRNA gene reads), Alphaproteobacteria (19.1‚Äì24.2\%), Gammaproteobacteria (7.9‚Äì11.1\%), Actinobacteria (5.5‚Äì13.2\%), Planctomycetes (7.2‚Äì9.5\%), and Verrucomicrobia (5.1‚Äì9.5\%). The distinctive feature of this community was high proportion of Subdivision 2 Acidobacteria, which are not characteristic for boreal Sphagnum peat bogs. Methanotrophic community composition was determined by molecular analysis of the pmoA gene encoding particulate methane monooxygenase. Most ({\textasciitilde}80\%) of all pmoA gene fragments revealed in peat from lichen-dominated sites belonged to the phylogenetic lineage represented by a microaerobic spiral-shaped methanotroph, ‚ÄúCandidatus Methylospira mobilis‚Äù. Members of the genus Methylocystis, which are typical inhabitants of boreal Sphagnum peat bogs, represented only a minor group of indigenous methanotrophs. The specific feature of a methanotrophic community in peat from lichen-dominated sites was the presence of uncultivated USCŒ± (Upland Soil Cluster alpha) methanotrophs, which are typical for acidic upland soils showing atmospheric methane oxidation. The methanotrophic community composition in lichen-dominated sites of a tundra wetland, therefore, was markedly different from that in boreal Sphagnum peat bogs.},

The sMMO catalytic cycle has been elucidated in detail, including O2 activation intermediates and the nature of the methane-oxidizing species. By contrast, many aspects of pMMO catalysis remain unclear, most notably the nuclearity and molecular details of the copper active site. Here, we review the current state of knowledge for both enzymes, and consider pMMO O2 activation intermediates suggested by computational and synthetic studies in the context of existing biochemical data.

	abstract = {Methane was the most abundant hydrocarbon released during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Beyond relevancy to this anthropogenic event, this methane release simulates a rapid and relatively short-term natural release from hydrates into deep water. Based on methane and oxygen distributions measured at 207 stations throughout the affected region, we find that within {\textasciitilde}120 days from the onset of release {\textasciitilde}3.0 √ó 1010 to 3.9 √ó 1010 moles of oxygen were respired, primarily by methanotrophs, and left behind a residual microbial community containing methanotrophic bacteria. We suggest that a vigorous deepwater bacterial bloom respired nearly all the released methane within this time, and that by analogy, large-scale releases of methane from hydrate in the deep ocean are likely to be met by a similarly rapid methanotrophic response.
Methane released during the Deepwater Horizon blowout was degraded by methanotrophic bacteria.

As a result, these organisms are difficult to identify and are often missed with existing cultivation and gene retrieval methods. Here, we demonstrate a novel proof of concept: using environmentally-relevant substrate concentrations in stable-isotope probing (SIP) incubations to yield sufficient DNA for large-insert metagenomic analysis through multiple displacement amplification (MDA). A marine surface-water sample was labelled sufficiently by incubation with near in situ concentrations of methanol. Picogram quantities of labelled 13C-DNA were purified from caesium chloride gradients, amplified with MDA to produce microgram amounts of high-molecular-weight DNA (‚â§¬†40¬†kb) and cloned to produce a fosmid library of {\textgreater}¬†10¬†000 clones. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) demonstrated minimal bias associated with the MDA step and implicated Methylophaga-like phylotypes with the marine metabolism of methanol. Polymerase chain reaction screening of 1500 clones revealed a methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) containing insert and shotgun sequencing of this insert resulted in the assembly of a 9-kb fragment of DNA encoding a cluster of enzymes involved in MDH biosynthesis, regulation and assembly. This novel combination of methodology enables future structure‚Äìfunction studies of microbial communities to achieve the long-desired goal of identifying active microbial populations using in situ conditions and performing a directed metagenomic analysis for these ecologically relevant microorganisms.},

	abstract = {Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) contains as much carbon as the Earth's atmosphere, and represents a critical component of the global carbon cycle. To better define microbial processes and activities associated with marine DOM cycling, we analyzed genomic and transcriptional responses of microbial communities to high-molecular-weight DOM (HMWDOM) addition. The cell density in the unamended control remained constant, with very few transcript categories exhibiting significant differences over time. In contrast, the DOM-amended microcosm doubled in cell numbers over 27 h, and a variety of HMWDOM-stimulated transcripts from different taxa were observed at all time points measured relative to the control. Transcripts significantly enriched in the HMWDOM treatment included those associated with two-component sensor systems, phosphate and nitrogen assimilation, chemotaxis, and motility. Transcripts from Idiomarina and Alteromonas spp., the most highly represented taxa at the early time points, included those encoding TonB-associated transporters, nitrogen assimilation genes, fatty acid catabolism genes, and TCA cycle enzymes. At the final time point, Methylophaga rRNA and non-rRNA transcripts dominated the HMWDOM-amended microcosm, and included gene transcripts associated with both assimilatory and dissimilatory single-carbon compound utilization. The data indicated specific resource partitioning of DOM by different bacterial species, which results in a temporal succession of taxa, metabolic pathways, and chemical transformations associated with HMWDOM turnover. These findings suggest that coordinated, cooperative activities of a variety of bacterial ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù may be critical in the cycling of marine DOM, emphasizing the importance of microbial community dynamics in the global carbon cycle.},

We quantitatively substantiate these predictions by using a variety of data from the Mississippi River continental shelf, a system in which the Si:DIN loading ratio has declined from around 3:1 to 1:1 during this century because of land-use practices in the watershed. We suggest that, on this shelf, when the Si:DIN ratio in the river decreases to less than 1:1, then (i) copepod abundance changes from {\textgreater}75\% to {\textless}30\% of the total mesozooplankton, (ii) zooplankton fecal pellets become a minor component of the in situ primary production consumed, and (iii) bottom-water oxygen consumption rates become less dependent on relatively fast-sinking (diatom-rich) organic matter packaged mostly as zooplankton fecal pellets. This coastal ecosystem appears to be a pelagic food web dynamically poised to be either a food web composed of diatoms and copepods or one with potentially disruptive harmful algal blooms. The system is directed between these two ecosystem states by Mississippi River water quality, which is determined by land-use practices far inland.},

These changes suggest improved accuracy of HPSEC molecular weight measurements that we attribute to improved accuracy of PSS standards and changes in the column packing. We also isolated DOM from wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) using XAD-8, a cation exchange resin, and PPL, a styrene-divinylbenzene media, and observed little difference in molecular weight and specific UV absorbance at 280 nm (SUVA280) between the two solid phase extraction resins, suggesting they capture similar DOM moieties. PPR DOM also showed lower SUVA280 at similar molecular weights as DOM isolates from a global range of environments, which we attribute to oxidized sulfur in PPR DOM that would increase molecular weight without affecting SUVA280.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is arguably one of the most complex exometabolomes on earth, and is comprised of thousands of compounds, that together contribute more than 600√ó1015 g carbon. This reservoir is primarily the product of interactions between the upper ocean‚Äôs microbial food web, yet abiotic processes that occur over millennia have also modified many of its molecules. The compounds within this reservoir play important roles in determining the rate and extent of element exchange between inorganic reservoirs and the marine biosphere, while also mediating microbe-microbe interactions. As such, there has been a widespread effort to characterize DOM using high-resolution analytical methods including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). To date, molecular information in DOM has been primarily obtained through calculated molecular formulas from exact mass. This approach has the advantage of being non-targeted, accessing the inherent complexity of DOM. Molecular structures are however still elusive and the most commonly used instruments are costly. More recently, tandem mass spectrometry has been employed to more precisely identify DOM components through comparison to library mass spectra. Here we describe a data acquisition and analysis workflow that expands the repertoire of high-resolution analytical approaches available to access the complexity of DOM molecules that are amenable to electrospray ionization (ESI) MS. We couple liquid chromatographic separation, with tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) and a data analysis pipeline, that integrates peak extraction from extracted ion chromatograms (XIC), molecular formula calculation and molecular networking. This provides more precise structural characterization. Although only around 1\% of detectable DOM compounds can be annotated through publicly available spectral libraries, community-wide participation in populating and annotating DOM datasets could rapidly increase the annotation rate and should be broadly encouraged. Our analysis also identifies shortcomings of the current data analysis workflow that need to be addressed by the community in the future. This work will lay the foundation for an integrative, non-targeted molecular analysis of DOM which, together with next generation sequencing, meta-proteomics and physical data, will pave the way to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of DOM in structuring marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {A nonlinear inverse method is applied to nutrient data upon approximately 20 neutral surfaces in each of the South Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific basins, between 400 and 4000 m depth. By accounting for the gradients in nutrients due to the mixing of ‚Äúpreformed‚Äù concentrations of the major water masses, the nutrient changes due to biological activity are examined, and the time-mean, basin-wide Redfield ratios calculated. It is found that the P/N/Corg/‚àíO2 ratios of nutrient regeneration between 400 and 4000 m (corrected for the effect of denitrification) are approximately constant with depth and basin, at a value of 1/16 ¬± 1/117 ¬± 14/170 ¬± 10. These ratios agree with those of fresh organic matter, suggesting that the flux of organic material to the deep ocean may be dominated by fast-sinking matter produced by sporadic, high-productivity events. Sedimentary denitrification reduces the N/P utilization ratio to 12 ¬± 2 between 1000 and 3000 m. In the Indian and Pacific basins the Corg/Cinorg regeneration ratio decreases from approximately 7 ¬± 3 at 400 m to 3 ¬± 1 at 1000 m and to 1 ¬± 0.5 at 4000 m, suggesting a significant amount of calcium carbonate dissolution above the calcite lysoclines in the Indian and Pacific oceans.},

	abstract = {Selective removal of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool has been reported in several regional studies. Because DOM is an important advective/mixing pathway of carbon (C) export from the ocean surface layer and its non-Redfieldian stoichiometry would affect estimates of marine export production per unit N and P, we investigated the stoichiometry of marine DOM and its remineralization globally using a compiled DOM data set. Marine DOM is enriched in C and N compared to Redfield stoichiometry, averaging 317:39:1 and 810:48:1 for C:N:P within the degradable and total bulk pools, respectively. Dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) is found to be preferentially remineralized about twice as rapidly with respect to the enriched C:N stoichiometry of marine DOM. Biogeochemical simulations with the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling model using Redfield and variable DOM stoichiometry corroborate the need for non-Redfield dynamics to match the observed DOM stoichiometry. From our model simulations, preferential DOP remineralization is found to increase the strength of the biological pump by {\textasciitilde}9\% versus the case of Redfield DOM cycling. Global net primary productivity increases {\textasciitilde}10\% including an increase in marine nitrogen fixation of {\textasciitilde}26\% when preferential DOP remineralization and direct utilization of DOP by phytoplankton are included. The largest increases in marine nitrogen fixation, net primary productivity, and carbon export are observed within the western subtropical gyres, suggesting the lateral transfer of P in the form of DOP from the productive eastern and poleward gyre margins may be important for sustaining these processes downstream in the subtropical gyres.},

In this study, elemental stoichiometries and chemical compositions of particulate and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated in the euphotic and upper mesopelagic zones of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The distributions of bacterial biomarkers (D-amino acids, muramic acid) and major biochemicals (amino acids, neutral sugars, amino sugars) indicated a direct link between microbial community structure and the biochemical composition of organic matter. Bacteria were major sources of organic C, N, and P in the upper mesopelagic zone. Heterotrophic bacterial transformations were important in the formation of biorefractory organic matter that is retained in the ocean on timescales of decades to millennia. Net removal rates for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and major biochemicals were calculated for the upper mesopelagic zone (110‚Äì300 m). Dissolved hydrolyzable amino acids, neutral sugars, and amino sugars comprised 5‚Äì18\% of DOC and 4‚Äì5\% of DON removed in the upper mesopelagic zone, indicating these biochemicals were important components of semilabile DOM. Net removal rates of neutral sugars were 3‚Äì10 times higher than net removal rates of amino acids and amino sugars. This suggested that neutral sugars were the most reactive component among the three classes of biochemicals. Depth-integrated net DOC removal rates indicated that DOC comprised 19‚Äì31\% of total carbon export flux in the North Pacific gyre and supplied 27‚Äì93\% of bacterial carbon demand in the upper mesopelagic zone.},

	abstract = {Climate change in the Arctic is ongoing and causes drastic modification on the ecosystem functioning. In soft-bottom environments, organic matter remineralization is considered an important ecosystem function. Here we provide a large-scale assessment of the current knowledge on the benthic organic matter remineralization and its potential response to climate change. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) values (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1154), measured throughout the Arctic, were gathered from 30 publications and 16 databases, and nutrient flux values, available in a far lesser extent (n‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ80), were also compiled. Generalized additive models were used to estimate the influence of explanatory variables on benthic oxygen fluxes and for interpolating SOD to the whole Arctic region. This first Pan-Arctic review of the distributions of SOD showed that oxygen fluxes strongly depended on water depth, i.e., followed the general trend observed for other regions, and also on the availability of labile organic matter. The continental shelves (representing {\textasciitilde}50\% of Arctic Ocean's total area) were characterized by the highest SOD values (10.5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ7.9‚Äâmmol‚ÄâO2‚Äâm‚àí2‚Äâd‚àí1), and differences among shelves were observed; SOD values in inflow, interior, and outflow shelves were 11.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ8.0, 6.2‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ5.6, and 3.9‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.5‚Äâmmol‚ÄâO2‚Äâm‚àí2‚Äâd‚àí1, respectively. Moreover, seasonal variation in SOD changed significantly among areas. The interpolation based on the best fitted model showed high respiration in the inflow and interior shelves. In the inflow shelves, characterized by productive waters, benthic activities replenish bottom water with nutrients which may augment primary productivity, whereas sediments from the interior shelves, e.g., under the direct influence of the Mackenzie River, consume nutrients.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have indicated that biological activity is higher in the central Arctic Ocean than once thought. To assess the contribution of heterotrophic processes, we examined bacterial production and the uptake of specific components of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool during a trans-Arctic expedition. Bacterial production generally covaried with phytoplankton production and bacterial numbers; the highest values of all three parameters were in the more open waters of the Chukchi Sea and they were generally lower at the other stations which were covered by ice. Although bacterial production correlated with phytoplankton production, the ratio of bacterial to phytoplankton production (BP:PP) varied substantially. It was lowest (BP:PP{\textless}0.1) at stations with some open water and highest at ice-covered stations, sometimes exceeding 1, depending on how bacterial production was measured. These high BP:PP ratios imply that bacterial respiration and DOM fluxes are large. This bacterial activity could be accounted for by the uptake of dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) and glucose. Uptake of these DOM components was high because of rapid turnover and high concentrations, especially of DFAA. Concentrations of dissolved combined neutral carbohydrates (e.g. polysaccharides) were often also high compared to other environments. These data indicate that heterotrophic bacteria and the rest of the microbial loop are large and active components of the biological community in the Arctic Ocean in spite of perennially low temperatures.},

	abstract = {The link between pelagic and benthic systems has been suggested to be particularly strong on Arctic continental shelves. Differing sampling strategies and the multitude of pelagic and benthic parameters that have been compared, however, make it difficult to determine the limitations of this important ecosystem concept. We sampled across multiple gradients in water mass characteristics, ice cover, productivity regimes, and seasons to test the generality of the pelagic‚Äìbenthic coupling paradigm during a 3-year study (2003‚Äì2005) in the Barents Sea. While benthic community structure varied among stations, biomass was not significantly correlated with sediment oxygen demand (SOD), a finding contrary to some published studies. Average SOD varied from 2.3 to 7.3mmol O2m‚àí2d‚àí1, and was (positively) correlated as well with sediment pigments, as it was with the vertical flux of pigments and carbon measured by sediment traps deployed at 90m. Export flux was also strongly coupled with our measure of benthic carbon cycling (SOD), suggesting that both processes vary on similar, short time scales (days to weeks). In contrast, processes responsible for patterns in benthic biomass reflect a response over longer time scales (several years), and are thus not well coupled with SOD. We conclude that conflicting results of studies assessing pelagic‚Äìbenthic coupling may not necessarily be due to general inconsistencies in the fundamental relationship, but instead to improper comparisons of parameters or processes that vary over different scales. These findings are particularly relevant for evaluating system processes in ecosystem modeling studies.},

High pelagic consumption and recycling reduce quantity and quality of vertically exported organic material, while low to moderate pelagic consumption allows more carbon of higher quality to reach benthic communities. To evaluate the driving forces influencing changes in quantity and composition of vertical flux with depth and environmental conditions in ice-covered waters, short-term sediment trap deployments at 6‚Äì8 depths from 20 to 200m were conducted. Eleven stations in the northern Barents Sea were investigated during early, peak and late bloom scenarios in 2003‚Äì2005. Vertical particulate organic carbon (POC) export ranged 140‚Äì760mgCm‚àí2d‚àí1 at 30m and 58‚Äì720mgCm‚àí2d‚àí1 at 90m depth. Strongest vertical carbon flux attenuation was observed during peak bloom scenarios. The pycnocline always defined the depth of the strongest attenuation. The POC export was highly correlated with Chl a flux (r2=0.89) and with a low POC/Chl a ratio, this indicates that fresh material is being exported to depth. A tight coupling between POC export at 90m and particulate PP (r2=0.61) was observed and suggests that on an average 36\% of daily PP was exported as POC. Deep vertical mixing observed in the Polar Front or less stable water masses did, however, enhance the vertical export and loss rates considerably. Annual estimates of vertical POC export to PP, suggests weaker retention, and thus stronger pelagic‚Äìbenthic coupling in Arctic compared to the Atlantic region of the Barents Sea.},

	abstract = {We present a carbon budget for the Arctic Ocean that is based on estimates of water mass transformation and transport. The budget is constrained by conservation of mass and salt. In the model, the Eurasian and Canadian basins have been divided into five and six boxes, respectively, based on the prevailing water masses. In addition, there are three boxes representing the shelf areas. Total dissolved inorganic (CT) and organic (TOC) carbon concentrations for the different water masses and different regions are used, together with the volume flows, to calculate the carbon transports. The carbon budget calculation shows that at present the oceanic transport into the Arctic Ocean is larger than out, that is, 3.296¬±0.008 Gt C yr‚àí1 of CT transported in and 3.287¬±0.004 Gt C yr‚àí1 transported out with the corresponding values for TOC being 0.134¬±0.009 Gt C yr‚àí1 and 0.122¬±0.006 Gt C yr‚àí1, respectively. However, the outflowing waters are older than the inflowing waters and had thus been exposed to an atmosphere with lower concentration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide when entering the Arctic Ocean. When recalculating the budget to the preindustrial scenario, assuming steady state, the CT transport changes to 3.243 Gt C yr‚àí1 in and 3.266 Gt C yr‚àí1 out. To balance the preindustrial transports, assuming no change in the TOC fluxes, a direct input of atmospheric carbon dioxide of 0.011¬±0.014 Gt C yr‚àí1 is required. Added to this is the burial of organic matter which is calculated as 0.013¬±0.010 Gt C yr‚àí1 using a recycling efficiency of 80 \% [Hulth, 1995] and a new production of 0.05 Gt C yr‚àí1 [Anderson et al., 1994]. An indirect contribution of atmospheric carbon dioxide via runoff adds 0.017¬±0.004 Gt C yr‚àí1, resulting in a preindustrial total atmospheric input of 0.041 ¬±0.018 Gt C yr‚àí1.},

Two key controlling parameters are the growth efficiencies of the principal trophic components and the rate of carbon remineralization. We report that bacterial growth efficiency is an inverse function of temperature. This relationship permits bacterial respiration in the euphotic zone to be computed from temperature and bacterial production. Using the temperature-growth efficiency relationship, we show that bacterial respiration generally accounts for most community respiration. This implies that a larger fraction of assimilated carbon is respired at low than at high latitudes, so a greater proportion of production can be exported in polar than in tropical regions. Because bacterial production is also a function of temperature, it should be possible to compute euphotic zone heterotrophic respiration at large scales using remotely sensed information.},

	abstract = {The phylogenetic composition of the heterotrophic microbial community is depth stratified in the oceanic water column down to abyssopelagic layers. In the layers below the euphotic zone, it has been suggested that heterotrophic microbes rely largely on solubilized particulate organic matter as a carbon and energy source rather than on dissolved organic matter. To decipher whether changes in the phylogenetic composition with depth are reflected in changes in the bacterial and archaeal transporter proteins, we generated an extensive metaproteomic and metagenomic dataset of microbial communities collected from 100- to 5,000-m depth in the Atlantic Ocean. By identifying which compounds of the organic matter pool are absorbed, transported, and incorporated into microbial cells, intriguing insights into organic matter transformation in the deep ocean emerged. On average, solute transporters accounted for 23\% of identified protein sequences in the lower euphotic and ‚àº39\% in the bathypelagic layer, indicating the central role of heterotrophy in the dark ocean. In the bathypelagic layer, substrate affinities of expressed transporters suggest that, in addition to amino acids, peptides and carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and compatible solutes may be essential substrates for the microbial community. Key players with highest expression of solute transporters were Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, accounting for 40\%, 11\%, and 10\%, respectively, of relative protein abundances. The in situ expression of solute transporters indicates that the heterotrophic prokaryotic community is geared toward the utilization of similar organic compounds throughout the water column, with yet higher abundances of transporters targeting aromatic compounds in the bathypelagic realm.},

	abstract = {The biodegradability of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (tDOM) exported to the sea has a major impact on the global carbon cycle, but our understanding of tDOM bioavailability is fragmentary. In this study, the effects of preparative tDOM isolation on microbial decomposition were investigated in incubation experiments consisting of mesocosms containing mesohaline water from the Baltic Sea. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) consumption, molecular DOM composition, bacterial activities, and shifts in bacterial community structure were compared between mesocosms supplemented with riverine tDOM, either as filtered, particle-free river water or as a concentrate obtained by lyophilization/tangential ultrafiltration, and those containing only Baltic Sea water or river water. As shown using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry (15 Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS) covering approximately 4600 different DOM compounds, the three DOM preparation protocols resulted in distinct patterns of molecular DOM composition. However, despite DOC losses of 4‚Äì16\% and considerable bacterial production, there was no significant change in DOM composition during the 28-day experiment. Moreover, tDOM addition affected neither DOC degradation nor bacterial dynamics significantly, regardless of the tDOM preparation. This result suggested that the introduced tDOM was largely not bioavailable, at least on the temporal scale of our experiment, and that the observed bacterial activity and DOC decomposition mainly reflected the degradation of unknown, labile, colloidal and low-molecular weight DOM, both of which escape the analytical window of FT-ICR-MS. In contrast to the different tDOM preparations, the initial bacterial inoculum and batch culture conditions determined bacterial community succession and superseded the effects of tDOM addition. The uncoupling of tDOM and bacterial dynamics suggests that mesohaline bacterial communities cannot efficiently utilize tDOM and that in subarctic estuaries other factors are responsible for the removal of imported tDOM.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in marine waters is a complex mixture of compounds and elements that contribute substantially to the global carbon cycle. The large reservoir of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) represents a vital resource for heterotrophic bacteria. Bacteria can utilise, produce, recycle and transform components of the DOM pool, and the physicochemical characteristics of this pool can directly influence bacterial activity; with consequences for nutrient cycling and primary productivity. In the present study we explored bacterial transformation of naturally occurring DOM across an extensive brackish water gradient in the Baltic Sea. Highest DOC utilisation (indicated by decreased DOC concentration) was recorded in the more saline southerly region where waters are characterised by more autochthonous DOM. These sites expressed the lowest bacterial growth efficiency (BGE), whereas in northerly regions, characterised by higher terrestrial and allochthonous DOM, the DOC utilisation was low and BGE was highest. Bacterial processing of the DOM pool in the south resulted in larger molecular weight compounds and compounds associated with secondary terrestrial humic matter being degraded, and a processed DOM pool that was more aromatic in nature and contributed more strongly to water colour; while the opposite was true in the north. Nutrient concentration and stoichiometry and DOM characteristics affected bacterial sctivity, including metabolic status (BGE), which influenced DOM transformations. Our study highlights dramatic differences in DOM characteristics and microbial carbon cycling in sub-basins of the Baltic Sea. These findings are critical for our understanding of carbon and nutrient biogeochemistry, particularly in light of climate change scenarios.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the main substrate and energy source for heterotrophic bacterioplankton. To understand the interactions between DOM and the bacterial community (BC), it is important to identify the key factors on both sides in detail, chemically distinct moieties in DOM and the various bacterial taxa. Next-generation sequencing facilitates the classification of millions of reads of environmental DNA and RNA amplicons and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry yields up to 10 000 DOM molecular formulae in a marine water sample. Linking this detailed biological and chemical information is a crucial first step toward a mechanistic understanding of the role of microorganisms in the marine carbon cycle. In this study, we interpreted the complex microbiological and molecular information via a novel combination of multivariate statistics. We were able to reveal distinct relationships between the key factors of organic matter cycling along a latitudinal transect across the North Sea. Total BC and DOM composition were mainly driven by mixing of distinct water masses and presumably retain their respective terrigenous imprint on similar timescales on their way through the North Sea. The active microbial community, however, was rather influenced by local events and correlated with specific DOM molecular formulae indicative of compounds that are easily degradable. These trends were most pronounced on the highest resolved level, that is, operationally defined ‚Äòspecies‚Äô, reflecting the functional diversity of microorganisms at high taxonomic resolution.},

	abstract = {A large quantity of reduced carbon is sequestered in the ocean as refractory dissolved molecules that persist through several circuits of global overturning circulation. Key aspects of the cycling of refractory dissolved organic carbon (DOC) remain unknown, making it challenging to predict how this large carbon reservoir will respond to climate change. Herein we investigate mechanisms that remove refractory DOC using bioassay experiments with DOC isolated from surface, mesopelagic and deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The isolated DOC was refractory to degradation by native microbial communities, even at elevated concentrations. However, when the refractory DOC was introduced to a series of novel environmental conditions, including addition of a labile substrate, a microbial community from coastal waters and exposure to solar radiation, a substantial fraction (7‚Äì13\%) was removed within 1.5 years. Our results suggest that while refractory molecules can persist in the ocean for millennia, removal is rapid when they encounter their fate. The observed and projected climate-induced slowdown of global overturning circulation could reduce the exposure of refractory molecules to disparate removal processes. Assuming a constant rate of production, the reservoir size of refractory DOC could increase as overturning circulation slows, providing a negative feedback to rising atmospheric CO2.},

	abstract = {Wetlands are one of the most significant natural sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. They emit CH4 because decomposition of soil organic matter in waterlogged anoxic conditions produces CH4, in addition to carbon dioxide (CO2). Production of CH4 and how much of it escapes to the atmosphere depend on a multitude of environmental drivers. Models simulating the processes leading to CH4 emissions are thus needed for upscaling observations to estimate present CH4 emissions and for producing scenarios of future atmospheric CH4 concentrations. Aiming at a CH4 model that can be added to models describing peatland carbon cycling, we composed a model called HIMMELI that describes CH4 build-up in and emissions from peatland soils. It is not a full peatland carbon cycle model but it requires the rate of anoxic soil respiration as input. Driven by soil temperature, leaf area index (LAI) of aerenchymatous peatland vegetation, and water table depth (WTD), it simulates the concentrations and transport of CH4, CO2, and oxygen (O2) in a layered one-dimensional peat column. Here, we present the HIMMELI model structure and results of tests on the model sensitivity to the input data and to the description of the peat column (peat depth and layer thickness), and demonstrate that HIMMELI outputs realistic fluxes by comparing modeled and measured fluxes at two peatland sites. As HIMMELI describes only the CH4-related processes, not the full carbon cycle, our analysis revealed mechanisms and dependencies that may remain hidden when testing CH4 models connected to complete peatland carbon models, which is usually the case. Our results indicated that (1)¬†the model is flexible and robust and thus suitable for different environments;¬†(2) the simulated CH4 emissions largely depend on the prescribed rate of anoxic respiration;¬†(3) the sensitivity of the total CH4 emission to other input variables is mainly mediated via the concentrations of dissolved gases, in particular, the O2 concentrations that affect the CH4 production and oxidation rates;¬†(4) with given input respiration, the peat column description does not significantly affect the simulated CH4 emissions in this model version.},

	abstract = {Dissolved CH4 among lake waters of the Mackenzie River Delta was tracked in 2014 to assess how river-to-lake connection times, plus carbon substrate quantity and quality, affects the patterns and dynamics of CH4. An under-ice survey of 29 lakes, three open-water surveys of 43 lakes, and weekly surveys of 6 lakes revealed that CH4 among lake-waters ranged from very high concentrations at the end of winter, with highest concentrations linked to shortest annual river connection times, to considerably lower concentrations as open water progressed, with a limited concentration range among lakes by late summer. Lakes most strongly affected by thermokarst varied irregularly from this pattern and did not have the highest CH4 concentrations. CH4 among lake waters was generally related to measures of carbon substrate quantity, where relations with macrophyte biomass and dissolved organic carbon in lake water were statistically stronger than \% organic matter within the lake sediments. CH4 was also directly related to the molecular weight (a[250]:a[365]) of dissolved organic matter at the end of winter, but was inversely related to this measure during open water. Carbon quality per se, after accounting for differences in carbon quantity (macrophyte biomass, dissolved organic carbon concentrations, or organic content of lake sediments), appears to play a significant role in controlling CH4 concentrations among the lake waters, particularly during winter ice cover. Carbon quality in lake sediments and of dissolved organic matter in winter lake waters appears to be as important as thermokarst augmentation of carbon quantity for enhancing methanogenesis in this lake-rich Arctic system.},

	title = {Critical {Theory}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/critical-theory/},
	abstract = {Critical Theory has a narrow and a broad meaning in philosophy and inthe history of the social sciences. ‚ÄúCritical Theory‚Äù inthe narrow sense designates several generations of German philosophersand social theorists in the Western European Marxist tradition knownas the Frankfurt School. According to these theorists, a‚Äúcritical‚Äù theory may be distinguished from a‚Äútraditional‚Äù theory according to a specific practicalpurpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human‚Äúemancipation from slavery‚Äù, acts as a ‚Äúliberating‚Ä¶ influence‚Äù, and works ‚Äúto create a world whichsatisfies the needs and powers‚Äù of human beings (Horkheimer1972, 246).  Because such theories aim to explain andtransform all the circumstances that enslave human beings,many ‚Äúcritical theories‚Äù in the broader sense have beendeveloped. They have emerged in connection with the many socialmovements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of humanbeings in modern societies. In both the broad and the narrow senses,however, a critical theory provides the descriptive and normativebases for social inquiry aimed at decreasing domination and increasingfreedom in all their forms., Critical Theory in the narrow sense has had many different aspects andquite distinct historical phases that cross several generations, fromthe effective start of the Institute for Social Research in the years1929‚Äì1930, which saw the arrival of the Frankfurt Schoolphilosophers and an inaugural lecture by Horkheimer, to thepresent. Its distinctiveness as a philosophical approach that extendsto ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of history is mostapparent when considered in light of the history of the philosophy ofthe social sciences. Critical Theorists have long sought todistinguish their aims, methods, theories, and forms of explanationfrom standard understandings in both the natural and the socialsciences. Instead, they have claimed that social inquiry ought tocombine rather than separate the poles of philosophy and the socialsciences: explanation and understanding, structure and agency,regularity and normativity.  Such an approach, Critical Theoristsargue, permits their enterprise to be practical in adistinctively moral (rather than instrumental) sense. They do notmerely seek to provide the means to achieve some independent goal, butrather (as in Horkheimer's famous definition mentioned above) seek‚Äúhuman emancipation‚Äù in circumstances of domination andoppression. This normative task cannot be accomplished apart from theinterplay between philosophy and social science throughinterdisciplinary empirical social research (Horkheimer 1993). WhileCritical Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to theFrankfurt School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretchesto Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similarpractical aims could be called a ‚Äúcritical theory,‚Äùincluding feminism, critical race theory, and some forms ofpost-colonial criticism. In the following, Critical Theory whencapitalized refers only to the Frankfurt School. All other uses of theterm are meant in the broader sense and thus not capitalized. Whenused in the singular, ‚Äúa critical theory‚Äù is notcapitalized, even when the theory is developed by members of theFrankfurt School in the context of their overall project of CriticalTheory., It follows from Horkheimer's definition that a critical theory isadequate only if it meets three criteria: it must be explanatory,practical, and normative, all at the same time. That is, it mustexplain what is wrong with current social reality, identify the actorsto change it, and provide both clear norms for criticism andachievable practical goals for social transformation. Any trulycritical theory of society, as Horkheimer further defined it in hiswritings as Director of the Frankfurt School's Institute for SocialResearch, ‚Äúhas as its object human beings as producers of theirown historical form of life‚Äù (Horkeimer 1993, 21). In light ofthe practical goal of identifying and overcoming all the circumstancesthat limit human freedom, the explanatory goal could be furthered onlythrough interdisciplinary research that includes psychological,cultural, and social dimensions, as well as institutional forms ofdomination. Given the emphasis among the first generation of CriticalTheory on human beings as the self-creating producers of their ownhistory, a unique practical aim of social inquiry suggests itself: totransform contemporary capitalism into a consensual form of sociallife. For Horkheimer a capitalist society could be transformed only bybecoming more democratic, to make it such that ‚Äúall conditionsof social life that are controllable by human beings depend on realconsensus‚Äù in a rational society (Horkheimer 1972, 249‚Äì250). Thenormative orientation of Critical Theory, at least in its form ofcritical social inquiry, is therefore towards the transformation ofcapitalism into a ‚Äúreal democracy‚Äù in which such controlcould be exercised (Horkheimer 1972, 250). In such formulations, thereare striking similarities between Critical Theory and Americanpragmatism., The focus on democracy as the location for cooperative, practical andtransformative activity continues today in the work of J√ºrgenHabermas, as does the attempt to determine the nature and limits of‚Äúreal democracy‚Äù in complex, pluralistic, and globalizingsocieties., As might be expected from such an ambitious philosophical project andform of inquiry, Critical Theory is rife with tensions. In whatfollows I will develop the arguments within Critical Theory thatsurround its overall philosophical project. First, I explore its basicphilosophical orientation or metaphilosophy. In its efforts to combineempirical social inquiry and normative philosophical argumentation,Critical Theory presents a viable alternative for social and politicalphilosophy today. Second, I will consider its core normativetheory‚Äîits relation to its transformation of a Kantian ethics ofautonomy into a conception of freedom and justice in which democracyand democratic ideals play a central role (Horkheimer 1993, 22;Horkheimer 1972, 203). As a member of the second generation ofCritical Theory, Habermas in particular has developed this dimensionof normative political theory into a competitor to Rawlsianconstructivism, which attempts to bring our pretheoretical intuitionsinto reflective equilibrium. In the third section, I will consider itsempirical orientation in practical social theory and practical socialinquiry that aims at promoting democratic norms. A fundamental tensionemerges between a comprehensive social theory that provides atheoretical basis for social criticism and a more pluralist andpractical orientation that does not see any particular theory ormethodology as distinctive of Critical Theory as such. In this way,the unresolved tension between the empirical and normative aspects ofthe project of a critical theory oriented to the realization of humanfreedom is manifest in each of its main contributions to philosophyinformed by social science. Finally, I examine the contribution ofCritical Theory to debates about globalization, in which the potentialtransformation of both democratic ideals and institutions is atstake.},

	abstract = {In the short, turbulent history of AIDS research and treatment, the boundaries between scientist insiders and lay outsiders have been crisscrossed to a degree never before seen in medical history. Steven Epstein's astute and readable investigation focuses on the critical question of "how certainty is constructed or deconstructed," leading us through the views of medical researchers, activists, policy makers, and others to discover how knowledge about AIDS emerges out of what he calls "credibility struggles."Epstein shows the extent to which AIDS research has been a social and political phenomenon and how the AIDS movement has transformed biomedical research practices through its capacity to garner credibility by novel strategies. Epstein finds that nonscientist AIDS activists have gained enough of a voice in the scientific world to shape NIH‚Äìsponsored research to a remarkable extent. Because of the blurring of roles and responsibilities, the production of biomedical knowledge about AIDS does not, he says, follow the pathways common to science; indeed, AIDS research can only be understood as a field that is unusually broad, public, and contested. He concludes by analyzing recent moves to democratize biomedicine, arguing that although AIDS activists have set the stage for new challenges to scientific authority, all social movements that seek to democratize expertise face unusual difficulties.Avoiding polemics and accusations, Epstein provides a benchmark account of the AIDS epidemic to date, one that will be as useful to activists, policy makers, and general readers as to sociologists, physicians, and scientists.},

The sites did not show any difference in salinity and, therefore, observed changes could be related to factors such as disparities in the biological activity and/or the impact of sediment resuspension rather than to location. Our results demonstrate that the POM pool has a higher bioavailability than the DOM pool, with the C, N, and P-containing compounds being more bioavailable than the C and N-containing molecules, which in turn are more labile than compounds containing just C. The addition of labile POM to the DOM pool did not impact the bioavailability of DOM, suggesting that priming had no major impact on the degradation of this pool in these experiments. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that 94\% and 75\% of the bioavailable N and P are contained in the organic fraction delivering enough nutrients to sustain phytoplankton productivity in the GBR. Using the obtained degradation rate constants and an average water residence time of 2 weeks, we show that most bioavailable POM ({\textgreater} 96\%) and DOM ({\textgreater} 83\%) is degraded before reaching the outer shelf. Our results emphasize that OM is a key and mostly unaccounted part of the C, N, and P cycles in tropical coastal waters of the GBR.},

Here, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization and microscopy, we demonstrate that prokaryotic cell abundances on seafloor-exposed basalts are 3‚Äì4 orders of magnitude greater than in overlying deep sea water. Phylogenetic analyses of basaltic lavas from the East Pacific Rise (9¬∞ N) and around Hawaii reveal that the basalt-hosted biosphere harbours high bacterial community richness and that community membership is shared between these sites. We hypothesize that alteration reactions fuel chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, which constitute a trophic base of the basalt habitat, with important implications for deep-sea carbon cycling and chemical exchange between basalt and sea water.},

	abstract = {Although fluids within the upper oceanic basaltic crust harbor a substantial fraction of the total prokaryotic cells on Earth, the energy needs of this microbial population are unknown. In this study, a nanocalorimeter (sensitivity down to 4.3 x 10-3 mJ h-1 ml-1) was used to measure the enthalpy of microbially catalyzed reactions as a function of temperature in samples from two distinct crustal fluid aquifers. Microorganisms in unamended, warm (63 ¬∞C) and geochemically altered anoxic fluids taken from 292 meters sub-basement (msb) near the Juan de Fuca Ridge produced 267.3 mJ of heat over the course of 97 hours during a step-wise isothermal scan from 35.5 to 85.0 ¬∞C. Most of this heat signal likely stems from the germination of thermophilic endospores (6.66 x 104 cells ml-1FLUID) and their subsequent metabolic activity at temperatures greater than 50 ¬∞C. The average cellular energy consumption (1.79 x 10-7 kJ h-1 cell-1) reveals the high metabolic potential of a dormant community transported by fluids circulating through the ocean crust. By contrast, samples taken from 293 msb from cooler (3.8 ¬∞C), relatively unaltered oxic fluids, produced 12.8 mJ of heat over the course of 14 hours as temperature ramped from 34.8 to 43.0 ¬∞C. Corresponding cell-specific energy turnover rates (0.18 pW cell-1) were converted to oxygen uptake rates of 24.5 nmol O2 ml-1FLUID d-1, validating previous model predictions of microbial activity in this environment. Given that the investigated fluids are characteristic of expansive areas of the upper oceanic crust, the measured metabolic heat rates can be used to constrain boundaries of habitability and microbial activity in the oceanic crust.},

	abstract = {The oceanic basaltic basement contains the largest aquifer on Earth and potentially plays an important role in the global carbon cycle as a net sink for dissolved organic carbon (DOC). However, few details of the organic matter cycling in the subsurface are known because great water depths and thick sediments typically hinder direct access to this environment. In an effort to examine the role of water‚Äìrock‚Äìmicroorganism interaction on organic matter cycling in the oceanic basaltic crust, basement fluid samples collected from three borehole observatories installed on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge were analyzed for dissolved amino acids. Our data show that dissolved free amino acids (1‚Äì13nM) and dissolved hydrolyzable amino acids (43‚Äì89nM) are present in the basement. The amino acid concentrations in the ridge-flank basement fluids are at the low end of all submarine hydrothermal fluids reported in the literature and are similar to those in deep seawater. Amino acids in recharging deep seawater, in situ amino acid production, and diffusional input from overlying sediments are potential sources of amino acids in the basement fluids. Thermodynamic modeling shows that amino acid synthesis in the basement can be sustained by energy supplied from inorganic substrates via chemolithotrophic metabolisms. Furthermore, an analysis of amino acid concentrations and compositions in basement fluids support the notion that heterotrophic activity is ongoing. Similarly, the enrichment of acidic amino acids and depletion of hydrophobic ones relative to sedimentary particulate organic matter suggests that surface sorption and desorption also alters amino acids in the basaltic basement. In summary, although the oceanic basement aquifer is a net sink for deep seawater DOC, similar amino acid concentrations in basement aquifer and deep seawater suggest that DOC is preferentially removed in the basement over dissolved amino acids. Our data also suggest that organic carbon cycling occurs in the oceanic basaltic basement, where an active subsurface biosphere is likely responsible for amino acid synthesis and degradation.},

	abstract = {The permeable upper oceanic basement serves as a plausible habitat for a variety of microbial communities. There is growing evidence suggesting a substantial subseafloor biosphere. Here new time series data are presented on key inorganic species, methane, hydrogen and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in ridge flank fluids obtained from subseafloor observatory CORKs (Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kits) at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) boreholes 1301A and 1026B. These data show that the new sampling methods (Cowen et al., 2012) employed at 1301A result in lower contamination than earlier studies. Furthermore, sample collection methods permitted most chemical analyses to be performed from aliquots of single large volume samples, thereby allowing more direct comparison of the data. The low phosphate concentrations (0.06‚Äì0.2ŒºM) suggest that relative to carbon and nitrogen, phosphorus could be a limiting nutrient in the basement biosphere. Coexisting sulfate (17‚Äì18mM), hydrogen sulfide (‚àº0.1ŒºM), hydrogen (0.3‚Äì0.7ŒºM) and methane (1.5‚Äì2ŒºM) indicates that the basement aquifer at 1301A either draws fluids from multiple flow paths with different redox histories or is a complex environment that is not thermodynamically controlled and may allow co-occurring metabolic pathways including sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. The low DOC concentrations (11‚Äì18ŒºM) confirm that ridge flank basement is a net DOC sink and ultimately a net carbon sink. Based on the net amounts of DOC, oxygen, nitrate and sulfate removed (‚àº30ŒºM, ‚àº80ŒºM, ‚àº40ŒºM and ‚àº10mM, respectively) from entrained bottom seawater, organic carbon may be aerobically or anaerobically oxidized in biotic and/or abiotic processes.},

Quantitative models of organic matter degradation are therefore essential for understanding the chemical state and evolution of the Earth‚Äôs near-surface environment, and to forecast the biogeochemical consequences of ongoing regional and global change. The complex nature of biologically produced organic matter represents a major obstacle to the development of such models, however. Here, we compare the energetics of the oxidative degradation of a large number of naturally occurring organic compounds. By relating the Gibbs energies of half reactions describing the complete mineralization of the compounds to their average nominal carbon oxidation state, it becomes possible to estimate the energetic potential of the compounds based on major element (C, H, N, O, P, S) ratios. The new energetic description of organic matter can be combined with bioenergetic theory to rationalize observed patterns in the decomposition of natural organic matter. For example, the persistence of cell membrane derived compounds and complex organics in anoxic settings is consistent with their limited catabolic potential under these environmental conditions. The proposed approach opens the way to include the thermodynamic properties of organic compounds in kinetic models of organic matter degradation.},

Methane and sulfur-oxidising bacteria are the main primary producers, supporting a complex food web that includes bacteria, fungi and cave-adapted invertebrates. A range of methylotrophic bacteria in Movile Cave grow on one-carbon compounds including methylated amines, which are produced via decomposition of organic-rich microbial mats. The role of methylated amines as a carbon and nitrogen source for bacteria in Movile Cave was investigated using a combination of cultivation studies and DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) using 13C-monomethylamine (MMA). Two newly developed primer sets targeting the gene for gamma-glutamylmethylamide synthetase (gmaS), the first enzyme of the recently-discovered indirect MMA-oxidation pathway, were applied in functional gene probing. SIP experiments revealed that the obligate methylotroph Methylotenera mobilis is one of the dominant MMA utilisers in the cave. DNA-SIP experiments also showed that a new facultative methylotroph isolated in this study, Catellibacterium sp. LW-1 is probably one of the most active MMA utilisers in Movile Cave. Methylated amines were also used as a nitrogen source by a wide range of non-methylotrophic bacteria in Movile Cave. PCR-based screening of bacterial isolates suggested that the indirect MMA-oxidation pathway involving GMA and N-methylglutamate is widespread among both methylotrophic and non-methylotrophic MMA utilisers from the cave.},

	abstract = {OM43 is a clade of uncultured Œ≤-proteobacteria that is commonly found in environmental nucleic acid sequences from productive coastal ocean ecosystems, and some freshwater environments, but is rarely detected in ocean gyres. Ecological studies associate OM43 with phytoplankton blooms, and evolutionary relationships indicate that they might be methylotrophs. Here we report on the genome sequence and metabolic properties of the first axenic isolate of the OM43 clade, strain HTCC2181, which was obtained using new procedures for culturing cells in natural seawater. We found that this strain is an obligate methylotroph that cannot oxidize methane but can use the oxidized C1 compounds methanol and formaldehyde as sources of carbon and energy. Its complete genome is 1304¬†428¬†bp in length, the smallest yet reported for a free-living cell. The HTCC2181 genome includes genes for xanthorhodopsin and retinal biosynthesis, an auxiliary system for producing transmembrane electrochemical potentials from light. The discovery that HTCC2181 is an extremely simple specialist in C1 metabolism suggests an unanticipated, important role for oxidized C1 compounds as substrates for bacterioplankton productivity in coastal ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Continued warming of the Arctic Ocean in coming decades is projected to trigger the release of teragrams (1 Tg = 106 tons) of methane from thawing subsea permafrost on shallow continental shelves and dissociation of methane hydrate on upper continental slopes. On the shallow shelves ({\textless}100 m water depth), methane released from the seafloor may reach the atmosphere and potentially amplify global warming. On the other hand, biological uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) has the potential to offset the positive warming potential of emitted methane, a process that has not received detailed consideration for these settings. Continuous sea‚àíair gas flux data collected over a shallow ebullitive methane seep field on the Svalbard margin reveal atmospheric CO2 uptake rates (‚àí33,300 ¬± 7,900 Œºmol m‚àí2‚ãÖd‚àí1) twice that of surrounding waters and ‚àº1,900 times greater than the diffusive sea‚àíair methane efflux (17.3 ¬± 4.8 Œºmol m‚àí2‚ãÖd‚àí1). The negative radiative forcing expected from this CO2 uptake is up to 231 times greater than the positive radiative forcing from the methane emissions. Surface water characteristics (e.g., high dissolved oxygen, high pH, and enrichment of 13C in CO2) indicate that upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water from near the seafloor accompanies methane emissions and stimulates CO2 consumption by photosynthesizing phytoplankton. These findings challenge the widely held perception that areas characterized by shallow-water methane seeps and/or strongly elevated sea‚àíair methane flux always increase the global atmospheric greenhouse gas burden.},

	abstract = {Climatological mean monthly distributions of pH in the total H+ scale, total CO2 concentration (TCO2), and the degree of CaCO3 saturation for the global surface ocean waters (excluding coastal areas) are calculated using a data set for pCO2, alkalinity and nutrient concentrations in surface waters (depths less than 50 m), which is built upon the GLODAP, CARINA and LDEO database. The mutual consistency among these measured parameters is demonstrated using the inorganic carbon chemistry model with the dissociation constants for carbonic acid by Lueker et al. (2000) and for boric acid by Dickson (1990). The global ocean is divided into 24 regions, and the linear potential alkalinity (total alkalinity + nitrate) versus salinity relationships are established for each region. The mean monthly distributions of pH and carbon chemistry parameters for the reference year 2005 are computed using the climatological mean monthly pCO2 data adjusted to a reference year 2005 and the alkalinity estimated from the potential alkalinity versus salinity relationships. The climatological monthly mean values of pCO2 over the global ocean are compiled for a 4¬∞ x 5¬∞ grid for the reference year 2005, and the gridded data for each of 12 months are included in this database. This is updated version of Takahashi et al. (2009) for the reference year 2000 representing non-El Ni√±o years using a database of about 6.5 million pCO2 data (less coastal areas of North and South America) observed in 1957-2012 (Takahashi et al., 2013). The equatorial zone (4¬∞N-4¬∞S) of the Pacific is excluded from the analysis because of the large interannual changes associated with the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation events. The pH thus calculated ranges from 7.9 to 8.2. Lower values are located in the upwelling regions in the tropical Pacific and in the Arabian and Bering Seas; and higher values are found in the subpolar and polar waters during the spring-summer months of intense photosynthetic production. The vast areas of subtropical oceans have seasonally varying pH values ranging from 8.05 during warmer months to 8.15 during colder months. The warm tropical and subtropical waters are supersaturated by a factor of as much as 4.2 with respect to aragonite and 6.3 for calcite, whereas the cold subpolar and polar waters are less supersaturated only by 1.2 for aragonite and 2 for calcite because of the lower pH values resulting from greater TCO2 concentrations. In the western Arctic Ocean, aragonite undersaturation is observed.},

A plot of Kendrick mass defect versus Kendrick nominal mass sorts compounds into homologous series according to compound class (i.e., numbers of N, O, and S heteroatoms), type (number of rings plus double bonds), and degree of alkylation (number of CH2 groups), to yield unique elemental assignments from ultrahigh-resolution mass measurements in the 200‚àí900 Da range. Interpretation of such a vast compilation requires a simple (preferably graphical) means to differentiate between complex organic mixtures of different origin or processing. In an extension of the recently revived van Krevelen plot, each elemental composition is projected onto two or three axes according to its H/C, O/C, and/or N/C atomic ratios. The H/C ratio separates compounds according to degree of saturation, whereas O/C or N/C ratios separate according to O and N classes. We show that the three-dimensional van Krevelen diagram can completely separate different classes in pyridine-extracted coal or petroleum samples and can also graphically distinguish fossil fuels according to their nature (coal vs petroleum), maturation (coals of different rank), and processing (the same coal at two stages of liquefaction). The van Krevelen diagram thus appears well suited to amplifying and exposing compositional differences within and between complex organic mixtures.},

We therefore performed a set of laboratorial experiments aiming to better understand the role of DOM in the sulfur cycle and we found that CHOS compounds can be formed in aquatic systems by the addition of sulfide/bisulfide ions to lignin-like CHO compounds.

	abstract = {As one of the Earth‚Äôs largest active carbon pools, accounting for around 90\% of the organic carbon in the oceans, dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a fundamental role in carbon storage and other biogeochemical processes. It exists as a highly functionalized and complex mixture of organic compounds which are diverse in their source, reactivity, and history, with about 95\% of aquatic DOM mixture remaining un-identified on a molecular level. This thesis uses ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry to characterize the origin, composition, and lability of DOM in the aquatic system. In this thesis, water and sediment samples were collected from sampling sites in the Arctic Ocean, as well as the northern and southern slope of the Gulf of Mexico, to discern the compositional differences in DOM that occur geographically. The DOM of waters sampled across the different ecosystems show a homogenized composition with little variability in their compound class distribution, consisting primarily of NOx, N2Ox, N3Ox, and Ox classes, with a mass range between m/z 170‚Äì960. Along the water column, surface water DOM samples show the most variation in their relative intensity and abundance of multi-oxygenated species, owing to their susceptibility to photo-oxidation, in contrast to the more refractory and homogenized DOM in the bathypelagic ocean. Unlike the homogenized water DOM composition near the ocean floor, the water extractable organics from sediments underneath (top 15 cm of sediment) show significant variability in both the relative intensity and abundance of compound classes, geographically. Juxtaposed to the oxygen rich water DOM, the sediment water extractable organic matter (WEOM) are enriched in nitrogen containing species (N1-6O1-17) with smaller carbon number values. The changes in DOM from the water surface towards the sediment are attributed to the differences in solar irradiation exposure, availability of oxygen, and resident microbes. The nitrogen containing classes in sediment WEOM show compositional trends similar to melanoidins, suggesting the preservation of organics via melanoidin or melanoidin-like compounds in the sediments.  
Beyond the primary productivity from phyto- and zoo-plankton, marine DOM is fed by terrigenous input (atmospheric deposition or runoff) and anthropogenic sources (oil spills), which were both independently characterized. The WEOM from plant biomass (terrigenous input) comprise of species with heteroatom distributions of NOx, N2Ox, and Ox, with a high concentration of multi-oxygenated species, similar to that observed in the sampled marine water DOM. The WEOM from thermally oxidizing terrigenous plant biomass produces homogenized spectra, with an increased abundance of highly unsaturated moieties of decreasing bio-availability and lability, that closely resemble marine water DOM, suggesting that pyrogenesis yields a more refractory DOM whose characteristics are not greatly variable.  The anthropogenic input from oil spills comprise of species with heteroatom distributions of NOx, Ox, OxS, and OxS2, adding a high concentration of sulfur containing compounds to the water phase. The partitioning behavior of organics from oil to water phase during a submarine oil spill were found to depend greatly on the dissolved gas pressure. The dissolved gas pressure in the oil gushing from the wellhead, causes higher concentrations of organics to partition into the water phase as the plume approaches the water surface. The increased water temperature closer to surface further enhances this effect. The study showed that the addition of dispersants to the water phase, a commonly used spill response, increase the extent of organics partitioning from the oil into the water phase. The extent of partitioning was also found to increase twofold with the advent of in situ burning at the water surface, introducing highly condensed and oxidized aromatics into the water phase. It remains a herculean task to identify DOM at the molecular level in the various aquatic systems worldwide. This thesis has taken steps to identify both commonalities and variabilities in the DOM pool at various locations and depths, and increased the understanding of how various inputs are incorporated into this ever-evolving DOM make-up. This new information will help provide some of the pieces of one of the greatest remaining puzzles on earth, our oceans.},

	abstract = {Estuaries as connectors of freshwater and marine aquatic systems are hotspots of biogeochemical element cycling. In one of the best studied temperate estuaries, the Delaware Estuary (USA), we investigated the variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) over five sampling cruises along the salinity gradient in August and November of 3 consecutive years. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were more variable in the upper reaches of the estuary (245¬±49 ¬µmol L-1) than at the mouth of the estuary (129¬±14 ¬µmol L-1). Bulk DOC decreased conservatively along the transect in November but was non-conservative with increased DOC concentrations mid-estuary in August. Detailed analysis of the solid-phase extractable DOM pool via ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS) revealed compositional differences at the molecular level that were not reflected in changes in concentration. Besides the mixing of terrestrial and marine endmember signatures, river discharge levels and biological activity were found to impact DOM molecular composition. DOM composition changed less between August and November than along the salinity gradient. Relative contributions of presumed photolabile DOM compounds did not reveal non-conservative behavior indicative of photochemical processing; suggesting that on the timescales of estuarine mixing photochemical removal of molecules plays a minor role in the turbid Delaware Bay. Overall, a large portion of molecular formulae overlapped between sampling campaigns and persisted during estuarine passage. Extending the analysis to the structural level via the fragmentation of molecular masses in the FT-ICR-MS cell, we found that the relative abundance of isomers along the salinity gradient did not change, indicating a high structural similarity of aquatic DOM independent of the origin. These results point towards a recalcitrant character of the DOM supplied by the Delaware River. We demonstrate that in addition to bulk DOC quantification, detailed information on molecular composition is essential for constraining sources of DOM and to identify the processes that impact estuarine DOM, thereby controlling amount and composition of DOM eventually discharged to the ocean through estuaries.},

In the semi-closed basins of the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea, these gradual molecular modifications can be observed in close proximity. In order to extend the spatial resolution of information on DOM molecular composition available from ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry in this area, we relate this data to optical (fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy) measurements. Covariance between molecular formulae signal intensities and carbon-specific fluorescence intensities was examined by means of Spearman‚Äôs rank correlations. Fifty two per cent of the assigned molecular formulae were associated with at least one optical parameter, accounting for 70\% of the total mass spectrum signal intensity. Furthermore, we obtained significant multiple linear regressions between optical and intensity-weighted molecular indices. The resulting regression equations were used to estimate molecular parameters such as the double bond equivalent, degradation state and occurrence of unsaturated aliphatic compounds from optical measurements. The statistical linkages between DOM molecular and optical properties illustrate that the simple, rapid and cost-efficient optical spectroscopic measurements provide valuable proxy information on the molecular composition of open ocean marine DOM.},

	abstract = {The reporting and graphing of ecological data and statistical results often leave a lot to be desired. One reason can be a misunderstanding or confusion of some basic concepts in statistics such as standard deviation, standard error, margin of error, confidence interval, skewness of distribution and correlation. The implications of having small sample sizes are also often glossed over. In several situations, statistics and associated graphical representations are made for comparing groups of samples, where the issues become even more complex. Here, I aim to clarify these basic concepts and ways of reporting and visualizing summaries of variables in ecological research, both for single variables and for pairs of variables. Specific recommendations about better practice are made, for example describing precision of the mean by the margin of error and bootstrapping to obtain confidence intervals.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine bacterioplankton abundance and activity in the Barents Sea using the novel modified vital stain and probe (mVSP) method. The mVSP is a protocol that combines DAPI and propidium iodide staining with 16S rRNA eubacterial-specific oligonucleotide probes to determine the physiological status of individual microbial cells. Bacterial abundance and metabolic activity were measured in near-surface waters and with depth at stations in the central Barents Sea during a cruise in June/July 1999. Viral abundance was also determined for 19 transect stations and at depth (2‚Äì200 m) for five intensive 24-h stations. In general, bacterial and viral abundances varied across the transect, but showed peaks of abundance (6√ó109 cells l‚àí1, 9√ó109 viruses l‚àí1) in Polar Front water masses. Viruses were abundant in seawater and exceeded bacterial abundance. Metabolic activity was determined for individual cells using 16S rRNA eubacterial-specific oligonucleotide probes, and for the total community with 3H-leucine incorporation. Activity measured by oligonucleotide probes increased from south to north. The fraction of cells that were active was lowest in the southern Barents Sea (20\%) and highest in the Polar Front (53\%). The proportion of cells at the 24-h stations that were determined to be active decreased with depth, but not with distance from ice cover. Leucine incorporation rates varied significantly and did not always correlate with probe measurements. The proportion of total cells that had compromised membranes and were therefore considered dead remained relatively constant ({\textless}10\%) across the transect. The percent of dead cells in the near surface waters and at depth were statistically similar. The percent dead cells made up only a small fraction of the total population at the 24-h stations. The largest and most variable fraction of cells were those classified as low activity (25‚Äì80\%), which supports the hypothesis that a significant fraction of cells in aquatic ecosystems are inactive. Bacterioplankton production rates ranged from {\textless}0.05 to 2.8 mg C m‚àí3 day‚àí1. Growth rates ranged from {\textless}0.05 to 0.25 day‚àí1, implying turnover rates of 2.5 to {\textgreater}200 days. Our results demonstrate that bacterioplankton and viruses are dynamic but ubiquitous features of Arctic microbial communities. The contribution of bacteria and viruses to Arctic food webs is discussed.},

	abstract = {Optical properties are easy-to-measure proxies for dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, source and reactivity. However, the molecular signature of DOM associated with such optical parameters remains poorly defined. The Florida coastal Everglades is a subtropical wetland with diverse vegetation (e.g., sawgrass prairies, mangrove forests, seagrass meadows) and DOM sources (e.g., terrestrial, microbial and marine). As such, the Everglades is an excellent model system from which to draw samples of diverse origin and composition to allow classically-defined optical properties to be linked to molecular properties of the DOM pool. We characterized a suite of seasonally- and spatially-collected DOM samples using optical measurements (EEM-PARAFAC, SUVA254, S275-295, S350-400, SR, FI, freshness index and HIX) and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Spearman‚Äôs rank correlations between FTICR-MS signal intensities of individual molecular formulae and optical properties determined which molecular formulae were associated with each PARAFAC component and optical index. The molecular families that tracked with the optical indices were generally in agreement with conventional biogeochemical interpretations. Therefore, although they represent only a small portion of the bulk DOM pool, absorbance and fluorescence measurements appear to be appropriate proxies for the aquatic cycling of both optically-active and associated optically-inactive DOM in coastal wetlands.},

Photo-degradation with semi-continuous monitoring of EEMs and absorbance spectra was used to measure the photo-degradation kinetics and changes of the PARAFAC components in a depth profile of DOM at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) station in the Sargasso Sea. A five component model was fit to the EEMs, which included traditional terrestrial-like, marine-like, and protein-like components. Terrestrial-like components showed the expected high photo-reactivity, but surprisingly, the traditional marine-like peak showed slight photo-production in surface waters, which may account for its prevalence in marine systems. Surface waters were depleted in photo-labile components while protein-like fluorescent components were enriched, consistent with previous studies. Ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry detected unique aliphatic compounds in the surface waters at the BATS site, which may be photo-produced or photo-stable. Principle component and canonical analysis showed strong correlations between relative contributions of unsaturated/aromatic molecular formulas and depth, with aliphatic compounds more prevalent in surface waters and aromatic compounds in deep waters. Strong correlations were seen between these aromatic compounds and humic-like fluorescent components. The rapid photo-degradation of the deep-sea fluorescent DOM in addition to the surface water relative depletion of aromatic compounds suggests that deep-sea fluorescent DOM is very unlikely to survive overturning circulation.},

	abstract = {The optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are frequently used as tracers of water masses in bays and estuaries but present unique challenges in the ocean due to the small quantities of organic matter present and the similarities between spectra from coastal and offshore environments. Samples collected on trans-oceanic cruises in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans were used to investigate the optical characteristics of dissolved organic matter in waters with limited freshwater influence (salinity {\textgreater}30). Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) of fluorescence spectra revealed that coastal and oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence could be separated into at least eight separate components: 4‚Äì5 humic-like and 3‚Äì5 protein-like signals. Two of the humic components were identified as representing terrestrial organic matter and their signals could be traced in the open ocean (Pacific and Atlantic) at levels of approximately 1.5\% of riverine concentrations. An additional humic component, traditionally identified as the ‚Äúmarine‚Äù or ‚ÄúM‚Äù peak, was found to be both sourced from land and produced in the ocean. These results demonstrate that the supply, mixing and removal of terrestrial organic matter in oceanic waters can be observed with relatively simple measurement techniques, suggesting that fluorescence spectroscopy could play a useful role in future studies of the origin and fate of DOM in oceanic environments.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of dynamic interactions between natural organic matter (NOM) and microbial communities is critical not only to delineate the routes of NOM degradation/transformation and carbon (C) fluxes, but also to understand microbial community evolution and succession in ecosystems. Yet, these processes in subsurface environments are usually studied independently, and a comprehensive view has been elusive thus far. In this study, we fed sediment-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) to groundwater microbes and continually analyzed microbial transformation of DOM over a 50-day incubation. To document fine-scale changes in DOM chemistry, we applied high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS). We also monitored the trajectory of microbial biomass, community structure and activity over this time period. Together, these analyses provided an unprecedented comprehensive view of interactions between sediment-derived DOM and indigenous subsurface groundwater microbes. Microbial decomposition of labile C in DOM was immediately evident from biomass increase and total organic carbon (TOC) decrease. The change of microbial composition was closely related to DOM turnover: microbial community in early stages of incubation was influenced by relatively labile tannin- and protein-like compounds; while in later stages the community composition evolved to be most correlated with less labile lipid- and lignin-like compounds. These changes in microbial community structure and function, coupled with the contribution of microbial products to DOM pool affected the further transformation of DOM, culminating in stark changes to DOM composition over time. Our study demonstrates a distinct response of microbial communities to biotransformation of DOM, which improves our understanding of coupled interactions between sediment-derived DOM, microbial processes, and community structure in subsurface groundwater.},

	abstract = {Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) has proven to be a powerful technique revealing complexity and diversity of natural DOM molecules, but its application to DOM analysis in grazing-impacted agricultural systems remains scarce. In the present study, we presented a case study of using ESI-FTICR-MS in analyzing DOM from four headwater streams draining forest- or pasture-dominated watersheds in Virginia, USA. In all samples, most formulas were CHO compounds (71.8‚Äì87.9\%), with other molecular series (CHOS, CHON, CHONS, and CHOP (N, S)) accounting for only minor fractions. All samples were dominated by molecules falling in the lignin-like region (H/C = 0.7‚Äì1.5, O/C = 0.1‚Äì0.67), suggesting the predominance of allochthonous, terrestrial plant-derived DOM. Relative to the two pasture streams, DOM formulas in the two forest streams were more similar, based on Jaccard similarity coefficients and nonmetric multidimensional scaling calculated from Bray-Curtis distance. Formulas from the pasture streams were characterized by lower proportions of aromatic formulas and lower unsaturation, suggesting that the allochthonous versus autochthonous contributions of organic matter to streams were modified by pasture land use. The number of condensed aromatic structures (CAS) was higher for the forest streams, which is possibly due to the controlled burning in the forest-dominated watersheds and suggests that black carbon was mobilized from soils to streams. During 15-day biodegradation experiments, DOM from the two pasture streams was altered to a greater extent than DOM from the forest streams, with formulas with H/C and O/C ranges similar to protein (H/C = 1.5‚Äì2.2, O/C = 0.3‚Äì0.67), lipid (H/C = 1.5‚Äì2.0, O/C = 0‚Äì0.3), and unsaturated hydrocarbon (H/C = 0.7‚Äì1.5, O/C = 0‚Äì0.1) being the most bioreactive groups. Aromatic compound formulas including CAS were preferentially removed during combined light+bacterial incubations, supporting the contention that black carbon is labile to light alterations. Collectively, our data demonstrate that headwater DOM composition contains integrative information on watershed sources and processes, and the application of ESI-FTICR-MS technique offers additional insights into compound composition and reactivity unrevealed by fluorescence and stable carbon isotopic measurements.},

Nevertheless, the molecular-level composition of marine DOM has eluded detailed description, impeding inquiry into the specific mechanisms that add or remove compounds from the DOM pool. Here we describe the molecular-level composition of C18-extracted DOM along an east‚Äìwest transect of the North Atlantic Ocean. We examine the changes in DOM composition along this transect with ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and multivariate statistics. We use indicator species analysis (ISA) to identify possible source markers for photochemical degradation and heterotrophic bacterial metabolism. The inclusion of ISA in statistical evaluation of DOM mass spectral data allows investigators to determine the m/z values associated with significant changes in DOM composition. With this technique, we observe indicator m/z values in estuarine water that may represent components of terrestrially-derived chromophoric DOM subject to photochemical degradation. We also observe a unique set of m/z values in surface seawater and show that many of these are present in pure cultures of the marine Œ±-proteobacterium ‚Äò‚ÄòCandidatus Pelagibacter ubique‚Äù when grown in natural seawater. These findings indicate that a complex balance of abiotic and biotic processes controls the molecular composition of marine DOM to produce signatures that are characteristic of different environments.},

	abstract = {Rare CO2 flux measurements from Arctic pack ice show that two types of ice contribute to the release of CO2 from the ice to the atmosphere during winter and spring: young, thin ice with a¬†thin layer of snow and older (several weeks), thicker ice with thick snow cover. Young, thin sea ice is characterized by high salinity and high porosity, and snow-covered thick ice remains relatively warm (‚Äâ{\textgreater}‚Äâ‚ÄØ‚àí7.5‚ÄØ¬∞C) due to the insulating snow cover despite air temperatures as low as ‚àí40‚ÄØ¬∞C. Therefore, brine volume fractions of these two ice types are high enough to provide favorable conditions for gas exchange between sea ice and the atmosphere even in mid-winter. Although the potential CO2 flux from sea ice decreased due to the presence of the snow, the snow surface is still a¬†CO2 source to the atmosphere for low snow density and thin snow conditions.

	abstract = {Incubation experiments were performed to examine the processing of fresh autochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) produced by coastal plankton communities in spring and autumn. The major driver of observed DOM dynamics was the seasonally variable inorganic nutrient status and characteristics of the initial bulk DOM, whereas the characteristics of the phytoplankton community seemed to have a minor role. Net accumulation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during the 18-days experiments was 3.4 and 9.2 ¬µmol l‚àí1 d‚àí1 in P-limited spring and N-limited autumn, respectively. Bacterial bioassays revealed that the phytoplankton-derived DOC had surprisingly low proportions of biologically labile DOC, 12.6\% (spring) and 17.5\% (autumn). The optical characteristics of the DOM changed throughout the experiments, demonstrating continuous heterotrophic processing of the DOM pool. However, these temporal changes in optical characteristics of the DOM pool were not the same between seasons, indicating seasonally variable environmental drivers. Nitrogen and phosphorus availability is likely the main driver of these seasonal differences, affecting both phytoplankton extracellular release of DOM and its heterotrophic degradation by bacteria. These findings underline the complexity of the DOM production and consumption by the natural planktonic community, and show the importance of the prevailing environmental conditions regulating the DOM pathways.},

Tangential-flow ultrafiltration was used to separate HMW and LMW DOC. More than 80\% of the DOC in Amazon River samples was recovered in the HMW fraction, whereas most marine DOC (up to 70\%) was of LMW. Bacterial growth efficiencies were consistently higher in the LMW fractions (16-66\%) than in the HMW fractions (8-39\%), indicating compositional differences in the two size fractions. In all experiments, measured rates of bacterial growth and respiration in HMW incubations were higher than those in LMW incubations. Carbon-normalized bacterial DOC utilization rates were 1.4‚Äì4-fold greater in the HMW fractions than in the LMW fractions, and a greater proportion (0.7‚Äì22.5\%) of HMW DOC was utilized per day than LMW DOC (0.5‚Äì6.6\%). All bacterial growth and respiration measurements indicated that HMW DOC was utilized to a greater extent than LMW DOC in all environments investigated. The traditional model of DOM degradation, stating that LMW compounds are most bioreactive, does not appear to apply to the bulk of natural DOM. Rather, the data and results from independent studies suggest a new conceptual model whereby the bioreactivity of organic matter decreases along a continuum of size (from large to small) and diagenetic state (from fresh to old). This size-reactivity continuum model suggests that the bulk of HMW DOM is more bioreactive and less diagenetically altered than the bulk of LMW DOM.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive data set of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption measurements is analysed in light of tracing the supply and distribution of dissolved organic matter in the Arctic Ocean. Two years of river data from six major Arctic rivers (Kolyma, Lena, Ob, Mackenzie, Yenisei, and Yukon) and measurements from a transect across the Arctic Ocean are presented. The results show that although the Lena River currently dominates the supply of DOC and CDOM, climate change induced increases in base flow discharge will likely increase the contribution of the Yenisei River. Seasonal variations in the spectral characteristics of CDOM in the rivers reflected the shift in the dominant source of organic matter from modern plant litter in the spring freshet to older more degraded material during winter low flow periods. Strong correlations were found between the river loading of CDOM and DOC across the systems studied indicating that in situ CDOM sensors could be used in the future to improve estimates of riverine DOC loading. CDOM in the surface waters of the Eurasian Basin was largely characterised as riverine material although extrapolations to riverine end member concentrations suggested that approximately half the riverine CDOM is removed during its transport across the shelf. In contrast the Canadian Basin surface waters were characterised by a much greater proportion of autochthonous CDOM. These differences in DOM quality in the surface waters of the two basins are hypothesised to also influence the extent to which material is remineralised during its passage through the Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {A high-temperature combustion (HTC) total organic carbon analyzer, which has significant design improvements over existing systems, was developed. The new injection system directly connects a loop-type autoinjector to the head of the HTC column. This connection facilitates the coupling of an autosampler to the injection system. The entire injection process is closed to the atmosphere, thereby improving the precision and eliminating potential contamination during injection. Injections can be made every 3‚àí5 min, depending on the injection and inorganic carbon sparging modes used. The HTC column was designed without a ‚Äúcold‚Äù zone or dead space at the top. These improvements eliminated the memory (or carry-over) effect, which is a potential problem in some HTC column designs. The HTC column is packed with pure quartz beads instead of a relatively expensive Pt-based catalyst, without loss in the oxidation efficiency, as indicated by 100\% recovery for various compounds with different refractory properties and by intercomparison with Pt-based HTC systems. The precision for seawater is ‚àº¬±0.6\% (RSD) at the 80 ŒºM C level. Typically, greater than 5000 injections of seawater can be made without significant deterioration of column performance. The effects of column temperature and carrier gas flow rate on the oxidation efficiency, sensitivity, and reproducibility are reported. Finally, evidence is presented that suggests that there is a relationship between the refractory nature of pure compounds and the peak width. This potential relationship may be a useful tool for quantifying the refractory nature of organic carbon in natural waters.},

	abstract = {Absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy are economical tools for tracing the supply, turnover and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The colored and fluorescent fractions of DOM (CDOM and FDOM, respectively) are linked by the apparent fluorescence quantum yield (AQY) of DOM, which reflects the likelihood that chromophores emit fluorescence after absorbing light. Compared to the number of studies investigating CDOM and FDOM, few studies have systematically investigated AQY spectra for DOM, and linked them to fluorescence quantum yields (–§) of organic compounds. To offer a standardized approach, a MATLAB toolbox for the determination of apparent quantum yields of DOM (aquaDOM), featuring two calculation approaches, was developed and used to derive AQYs for samples from the Norwegian Sea. –§ of the organic compounds varied between 0.00079 and 0.35, whereas the average AQY for DOM samples at 350 nm was 0.011 ¬± 0.003. The AQY at 350 nm increased with depth, while the AQY at 250 nm showed no trend. Laboratory tests indicated that –§ of compound mixtures are additive and represent an intermediate of the constituents. Additionally, the presence of non-fluorescent chromophores greatly suppressed calculated AQYs. Similar trends in the DOM AQY at 350 nm were observed in natural samples. We therefore hypothesize that fluorescence AQYs can indicate changes in the relative abundances of CDOM and FDOM. Additionally, the optical properties of 15 potential DOM constituents were determined and compared to more than 200 modelled spectra (PARAFAC components) in the OpenFluor database. Apparent matches, based on spectral similarity, were subsequently evaluated using molar fluorescence and absorbance. Five organic compounds were potential matches with PARAFAC components from 16 studies; however, the ability to confirm matches was limited due to multiple compounds exhibiting very similar spectra. This reiterates the fact that spectral similarity alone is insufficient evidence of the presence of particular compounds, and additional evidence is required.},

Whole-water (i.e., unfractionated) DOM was analyzed pre- and post-irradiation using ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), revealing the following three pools of DOM classified based upon their photoreactivity: (1) photo-resistant, (2) photo-labile, and (3) photo-produced. Photo-resistant DOM was heterogeneous, with most molecular classes represented, although only a small number of aromatics and no condensed aromatics were identified. The photoproduced pool was dominated by aliphatic compounds, although it included a small number of aromatics, including condensed aromatics. Aromatic compounds were the most photoreactive, with {\textgreater} 90\% being lost upon irradiation. Photochemistry also resulted in a significant drop in the number of molecules identified and a decrease in their structural diversity. The FT-ICR MS signatures of two classes of refractory organic matter, black carbon and carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM), were present in the sample prior to irradiation, indicating that the Congo River could be a significant exporter of recalcitrant DOM to the ocean. All black carbon-like molecules identified in the initial sample were lost during irradiation. Molecular signatures consistent with CRAM were also highly photo-labile, demonstrating that environmental solar irradiation levels are capable of removing these refractory compounds from aquatic systems. Irradiation also shifted the molecular signature of terrestrial DOM toward that of marine DOM, thereby complicating the task of tracking terrestrial DOM in the ocean.},

We also measure carbon dioxide partial pressures in glacier-fed streams. We show that the glacier organic matter is highly diverse, and that a significant fraction of this material is bioavailable. Phenolic compounds derived from vascular plants or soil dominate, together with peptides and lipids, potentially derived from in situ microbial communities. Combustion products, in contrast, seem to contribute only marginally to the DOM sampled. We further show that organic matter bioavailability is positively correlated with in-stream carbon dioxide concentrations. We suggest that glacier-derived DOM contributes to downstream carbon cycling in glacier-fed streams.

	abstract = {Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas and atmospheric mixing ratios have been increasing since 2005. Therefore, quantification of CH4 sources is essential for effective climate change mitigation. Here we report observations of the CH4 mixing ratios measured at Zeppelin Observatory (Svalbard) in the Arctic and aboard the Research Vessel (RV) Helmer Hanssen over the Arctic Ocean from June 2014 to December 2016, as well as the long-term CH4 trend measured at 15 the Zeppelin Observatory (Svalbard) from 2001-2017. We investigated areas over the European Arctic Ocean to identify possible hot spot regions emitting CH4 from the ocean to the atmosphere, and used state-of-the-art modelling (FLEXPART) combined with updated emissions inventories to identify CH4 sources. Furthermore, we collected air samples in the region as well as samples of gas hydrates, obtained from the sea floor using a new technique developed as part of this work. Using this new methodology, we evaluated the suitability of ethane and isotopic signatures (Œ¥13C in CH4) as tracers for ocean-to20 atmosphere CH4 emission. We show that the mean atmospheric CH4 mixing ratio in the Arctic increased by 5.9 ¬± 0.38 parts per billion by volume (ppb) per year (yr-1) from 2001-2017. Meanwhile most large excursions from the baseline CH4 mixing ratio over the European Arctic Ocean are due to long-range transport from land-based sources, lending confidence to the present inventories for high latitude CH4 emissions. However, we also identify a potential hot spot region with oceanatmosphere CH4 flux North of Svalbard (80.4¬∞N, 12.8¬∞E) of up to 26 nmol m-2 s-1 from a large mixing ratio increase at the 25 location of 30 ppb. Since this flux is highly consistent with previous constraints (both spatially and temporally), there is no evidence that the area of interest North of Svalbard is unique in the context of the wider Arctic. Rather, that the meteorology at the time of the observation was unique in the context of the measurement time series, i.e. we obtained, over the short course of the episode, measurements highly sensitive to emissions over an active seep site, without sensitivity to land based emissions.},

Five emergent plants (Typha orientalis, Cyperus alternifolius, Arundo domax, Iris pseudacorus, and Thalia dealbata) commonly used in CWs were selected for investigation. The greatest CH4 flux (annual mean 19.4 mg m‚àí2 h‚àí1) was observed from I. pseudacorus, while the lowest CH4 flux (7.1 mg m‚àí2 h‚àí1) was observed from Thalia dealbata. The CH4 flux from five emergent plants showed marked seasonal variation. Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) were weakly correlated with CH4 emissions, whereas total carbon (TC) and root biomass of plants were positively correlated with CH4 emissions. Quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) analysis indicated that the gene abundance of eubacterial 16S rRNA, particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) and methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) significantly differed among plant species. Differences in TC, root biomass, and dissolved oxygen (DO) caused by plant species were potential factors responsible for differences in methanogens, methanotrophs, and CH4 emissions. Methanobacteriaceae, Methanoregulaceae, Methanomicrobiaceae, and Methanosarcinaceae were the dominant families of methanogens. The pathways of methanogenesis from the five emergent plants differed, with the main pathway being hydrogenotrophic, while both hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens were involved in A. domax. Redundancy analysis (RDA) further indicated that emergent plant types had a profound influence on the methanogenic communities. Taken together, these results suggest emergent plant species can significantly influence CH4 fluxes in CW through microbial communities, biochemical pathways for methanogenesis, TC, and DO. Furthermore, plant species in CWs should be considered an important factor in evaluating greenhouse gases emission. Finally, it is necessary to effectively manage CWs vegetation to maximize their environmental benefits. Open image in new window Graphical abstract ·Öü},

	url = {https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/166283},
	abstract = {The chemical composition and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the 
dark ocean is still enigmatic. To better understand the role played by DOM in the global ocean 
carbon cycle, it is crucial to decipher its composition and mechanisms of production and 
degradation. Knowing how DOM persists for hundreds to thousands years in the ocean is also 
pivotal. Within this framework, the main purpose of this PhD thesis is to shed light on the 
elemental and molecular composition of DOM, identify the environmental drivers of DOM 
variability and gain knowledge about DOM bioavailability. 
This PhD thesis is framed in the trans‚ÄìMediterranean cruise HOTMIX 2014. The 
Mediterranean Sea (MedSea) is an oligotrophic semi‚Äìenclosed basin suitable to study the 
DOM dynamics as it comprises water mass formation areas with its own thermohaline 
circulation. The smaller size and faster ventilation rates of the MedSea compared to the global 
ocean allow DOM changes to be observed in shorter spatial and temporal scales. Further, the 
high temperature of the deep waters stimulates DOM mineralization in the dark MedSea},

	abstract = {The warming of the Arctic causes increased riverine discharge, coastal erosion, and the thawing of permafrost. Together, this is leading to an increased wash out of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (tDOM) into the coastal Arctic ecosystems. This tDOM may be anticipated to affect both carbon and nutrient flow in the microbial food web and microbial community composition, but there are few studies detailing this in Arctic marine ecosystems. We tested the effects of tDOM on the bacterial community composition and net-growth by extracting DOM from the active layer of permafrost soil and adding the aged tDOM concentrate to a natural microbial fjord community (Kongsfjorden, NW Svalbard). This resulted in an increased carbon load of 128 ¬µM in the tDOM treatment relative to the control of 83 ¬µM DOC. We observed changes in community composition and activity in incubations already within 12 hours where tDOM was added. Flow cytometry revealed that predominantly large bacteria increased in the tDOM treated incubations. The increase of this group correlated with the increase in relative abundance of the genus Glaciecola (Gammaproteobacteria). Glaciecola were initially not abundant in the bacterial community (0.6\%), but their subsequent increase up to 47\% after four days upon tDOM addition compared to 8\% in control incubations indicates that they are likely capable of degrading permafrost derived DOM. Further, according to our experimental results we hypothesize that the tDOM addition increased bacterivorous grazing by small protists and thus tDOM might indirectly also effect higher trophic levels of the microbial food web.},

The scheme consists of: (1) reproducible data collection under optimized FT-ICR/MS analytical conditions; (2) automatic mass-error correction and multivariate analyses for metabolome characterization using a newly developed metabolomics tool (DMASS software); (3) identification of marker metabolite candidates by searching a species-metabolite relationship database, KNApSAcK; and (4) structural analyses by an MS/MS method. The scheme was applied to metabolic phenotyping of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings treated with different herbicidal chemical classes for pathway-specific inhibitions. Arabidopsis extracts were directly infused into an electrospray ionization source on an FT-ICR/MS system. Acquired metabolomics data were comprised of mass-to-charge ratio values with ion intensity information subjected to principal component analysis, and metabolic phenotypes from the herbicide treatments were clearly differentiated from those of the herbicide-free treatment. From each herbicide treatment, candidate metabolites representing such metabolic phenotypes were found through the KNApSAcK database search. The database search and MS/MS analyses suggested dose-dependent accumulation patterns of specific metabolites including several flavonoid glycosides. The metabolic phenotyping scheme on the basis of FT-ICR/MS coupled with the DMASS program is discussed as a general tool for high throughput metabolic phenotyping studies.},

The model was able to reproduce DOM and planktonic biomass distributions, uptake rates, and production rates (including DOM) that fell within ranges reported for oceanic, coastal, and estuarine systems. Using a sensitivity analysis we show that DOM cycling was intricately tied to the biomass concentration, distribution, and productivity of plankton. The efficiency of nutrient remineralization and the availability of inflowing nutrients and DON also played a large role in DOM cycling. In these simulations the largest autochthonous source of DOC was always phytoplankton exudation while important sources of DON varied considerably. In the oceanic simulations heterotrophic bacteria were particularly important for mediating DOM cycling because they were the primary agents that controlled nutrient recycling and supply (i.e., strong bottom-up control). In contrast, in the estuarine simulations mortality (mainly from grazing and viral lysis) had the most influence on DOM production. However, DOM cycling was generally less dependent on interactions between plankton in the estuarine case because of high nutrient and DOM loading. The coastal simulations were somewhere in between. In all simulations competition between different size classes of phytoplankton also played an important role in DOM cycling.},

and organic carbon (glucose) additions on bacterial and phytoplankton growth. Four experiments were conducted in each environment. Phytoplankton growth was monitored over a 36 h period by following changes in the concentration of chlorophyll in
unfiltered seawater and in seawater prefiltered through 5 Œºm screening to reduce grazing pressure. Bacterial production was estimated initially and after 24 h using the 3H-thymidine (TdR) method in unfiltered seawater and in 1 Œºm filtrate.
Phytoplankton biomass increased significantly in response to nutrient additions in all but 1 experiment, whereas chlorophyll concentrations remained unchanged or decreased in all of the unamended (control) treatments or treatments supplemented with
glucose. Responses of the phytoplankton community were similar for the {\textless}5 Œºm and unfiltered treatments. Bacterial production increased after 24 h in all of the treatments on Georges Bank, and there was little effect of nutrient or glucose addition in
unfiltered seawater relative to unamended controls. However, glucose addition to the {\textless}1 Œºm filtrate caused substantial increases in bacterial production relative to controls and N/P-amended treatments in 2 of the experiments from this environment.
Glucose had no stimulatory effect (relative to unamended treatments) in 3 of the 4 Sargasso Sea experiments, and only a marginal effect in the fourth. However, the addition of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in the latter ecosystem resulted in higher
bacterial production (relative to unamended treatments or glucose addition) in 2 of the experiments with unfiltered seawater, and very large increases in 3 of the experiments with 1 Œºm filtrate. The magnitude of the changes in bacterial production
differed greatly between unfiltered and filtered seawater in both ecosystems, indicating an important role for bacterial grazers in controlling bacterial population growth. The results of this study indicate different nutritional restraints on bacterial
production in these contrasting environments.},

	abstract = {Aerobic oxidation is an important methane sink in seawater overlying gas seeps. Recent surveys have identified active methane seeps in the waters of Hudson Canyon, US Atlantic Margin near the updip limit of methane clathrate hydrate stability. The close proximity of these seeps to the upper stability limit of methane hydrates suggests that changing bottom water temperatures may influence the release rate of methane into the overlying water column. In order to assess the significance of aerobic methane oxidation in limiting the atmospheric expression of methane released from Hudson Canyon, the total extent of methane oxidized along with integrated oxidation rates were quantified. These calculations were performed by combining the measurements of the natural levels of methane concentrations, stable carbon isotopes, and water current velocities into kinetic isotope models yielding rates ranging from 22.8¬±17 to 116¬±76nM/day with an average of 62.7¬±37nM/day. Furthermore, an average of 63\% of methane released into the water column from an average depth of 515m was oxidized before leaving this relatively small study area (6.5km2). Results from the kinetic isotope model were compared to previously-published but concurrently-sampled ex situ measurements of oxidation potential performed using 13C-labeled methane. Ex situ rates were substantially lower, ranging from 0.1 to 22.5nM/day with an average of 5.6¬±2.3nM/day, the discrepancy likely due to the inherent differences between these two techniques. Collectively, the results reveal exceptionally-rapid methane oxidation, with turnover times for methane as low as 0.3‚Äì3.7days, indicating that methane released to the water column is removed quantitatively within the greater extent of Hudson Canyon.},

Global methane flux from seabed cold seeps has only been estimated for continental shelves4, at 8 to 65 Tg CH4 yr‚àí1, yet other parts of marine continental margins are also emitting methane. The US Atlantic margin has not been considered an area of widespread seepage, with only three methane seeps recognized seaward of the shelf break. However, massive upper-slope seepage related to gas hydrate degradation has been predicted for the southern part of this margin5, even though this process has previously only been recognized in the Arctic2,6,7. Here we use multibeam water-column backscatter data that cover 94,000 km2 of sea floor to identify about 570 gas plumes at water depths between 50 and 1,700 m between Cape Hatteras and Georges Bank on the northern US Atlantic passive margin. About 440 seeps originate at water depths that bracket the updip limit for methane hydrate stability. Contemporary upper-slope seepage there may be triggered by ongoing warming of intermediate waters, but authigenic carbonates observed imply that emissions have continued for more than 1,000 years at some seeps. Extrapolating the upper-slope seep density on this margin to the global passive margin system, we suggest that tens of thousands of seeps could be discoverable.},

	abstract = {In response to warming climate, methane can be released to Arctic Ocean sediment and waters from thawing subsea permafrost and decomposing methane hydrates. However, it is unknown whether methane derived from this sediment storehouse of frozen ancient carbon reaches the atmosphere. We quantified the fraction of methane derived from ancient sources in shelf waters of the U.S. Beaufort Sea, a region that has both permafrost and methane hydrates and is experiencing significant warming. Although the radiocarbon-methane analyses indicate that ancient carbon is being mobilized and emitted as methane into shelf bottom waters, surprisingly, we find that methane in surface waters is principally derived from modern-aged carbon. We report that at and beyond approximately the 30-m isobath, ancient sources that dominate in deep waters contribute, at most, 10 ¬± 3\% of the surface water methane. These results suggest that even if there is a heightened liberation of ancient carbon‚Äìsourced methane as climate change proceeds, oceanic oxidation and dispersion processes can strongly limit its emission to the atmosphere.
Ancient methane emitted to Arctic Ocean shelf waters is largely prevented from reaching the atmosphere.

The large volume extracted gas sample is compressed into a 1.7 L cylinder for transport from the ship to the home laboratory. The home laboratory preparation of each sample to a CH4-derived carbon dioxide aliquot for 14C-AMS analysis is carried out in 3 h on a flow-through vacuum line that simultaneously prepares aliquots for stable isotope analyses (Œ¥13C-CH4 and Œ¥2H-CH4).

	abstract = {Methane seeps were investigated in Hudson Canyon, the largest shelf-break canyon on the northern U.S. Atlantic Margin. The seeps investigated are located at or updip of the nominal limit of methane clathrate hydrate stability. The acoustic identification of bubble streams was used to guide water column sampling in a 32 km2 region within the canyon's thalweg. By incorporating measurements of dissolved methane concentration with methane oxidation rates and current velocity into a steady state box model, the total emission of methane to the water column in this region was estimated to be 12 kmol methane per day (range: 6‚Äì24 kmol methane per day). These analyses suggest that the emitted methane is largely retained inside the canyon walls below 300 m water depth, and that it is aerobically oxidized to near completion within the larger extent of Hudson Canyon. Based on estimated methane emissions and measured oxidation rates, the oxidation of this methane to dissolved CO2 is expected to have minimal influences on seawater pH.},

However, to date, linkages between the optical dynamics of CDOM and dissolved CH4 levels remain largely unknown. We used multi-year seasonal data series (2012‚Äì2014) collected from Lake Taihu and 51 connecting channels to investigate how CDOM optical dynamics may impact dissolved CH4 levels in the lake. High dissolved CH4 in the northwestern inflowing river mouths coincided with high underwater UV-Vis light availability, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), DOM aromaticity, terrestrial humic-rich fluorescence, in situ measured terrestrial CDOM, and depleted dissolved oxygen (DO), stable isotopic Œ¥2H and Œ¥18O compared with other lake regions. Our results further revealed positive relationships between dissolved CH4 and CDOM absorption at 350 nm, i.e. a(350), COD, DOC, terrestrial humic-rich fluorophores, and DOM aromaticity, and negative relationships between dissolved CH4 and DO, Œ¥2H, and Œ¥18O. The central lake samples showed a major contribution of terrestrial-sourced molecular formulas to the ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry data, suggesting presence of allochthonous DOM sources even here. We conclude that an elevated terrestrial CDOM input likely enhances dissolved CH4 levels in Lake Taihu.},

This oceanic heat contributes to keeping the area relatively free of ice. The last years have seen a dramatic decrease in regional sea ice extent, which is expected to drive large increases in pelagic primary production and thereby changes in marine ecology and nutrient cycling. In a concerted effort, we conducted five cruises to the area in winter, spring, summer and fall of 2014, in order to understand the physical and biogeochemical controls of carbon cycling, for the first time from a year-round point of view. We document (1) the offshore location of the wintertime front between salty AW and fresher Surface Water in the ocean surface, (2) thermal convection of Atlantic Water over the shelf slope, likely enhancing vertical √±nutrient fluxes, and (3) the importance of ice melt derived upper ocean stratification for the spring bloom timing. Our findings strongly confirm the hypothesis that this ``Atlantification'', as it has been called, of the shelf slope area north of Svalbard resulting from the advection of AW alleviates both nutrient and light limitations at the same time, leading to increased pelagic primary productivity in this region.},

Hence, observations tend to be relatively sparse in both space and time. How the Arctic functions, geophysically, but also ecologically, can have significant consequences for the internal cycling of carbon, and subsequently influence carbon export, atmospheric CO2 uptake and food chain productivity. Here we assess the major carbon pools and associated processes, specifically summarizing the current knowledge of each of these processes in terms of data availability and ranges of rates and values for four geophysical Arctic Ocean domains originally described by Carmack \& Wassmann (2006): inflow shelves, which are Pacific-influenced and Atlantic-influenced; interior, river-influenced shelves; and central basins. We attempt to bring together knowledge of the carbon cycle with the ecosystem within each of these different geophysical settings, in order to provide specialist information in a holistic context. We assess the current state of models and how they can be improved and/or used to provide assessments of the current and future functioning when observational data are limited or sparse. In doing so, we highlight potential links in the physical oceanographic regime, primary production and the flow of carbon within the ecosystem that will change in the future. Finally, we are able to highlight priority areas for research, taking a holistic pan-Arctic approach.},

	abstract = {The main environmental factors driving spatial patterns, variability and change in primary production (PP) in the Arctic Ocean are reviewed. While instantaneous PP rates are predominantly influenced by the local factors affecting light penetration through clouds, sea ice and water, net PP (NPP) at the annual scale is conditioned by a hierarchy of remote and local processes that affect nutrient supply and light availability in general. Nutrient supply sets spatial differences in realized or potential trophic status (i.e. oligotrophic or eutrophic), whereas light availability modulates PP within each regime. Horizontal nutrient supply through Atlantic and Pacific ocean gateways differ markedly, which is explained by their position at opposite ends of the global meridional overturning circulation and imbalanced nitrogen (N) cycling in the Pacific sector. Nutrient supply by rivers is locally important, but does not appear to sustain a major portion of overall pan-Arctic NPP so far. Horizontal nutrient inputs to the surface Arctic Ocean are eventually transferred to the halocline through winter convection and the decomposition of settling organic matter. The subsequent re-injection of these nutrients to the euphotic zone varies by two orders of magnitude across sectors, depending on the strength and persistence of the vertical stratification. Such differences in nutrient delivery are commensurate with those of PP and NPP rates. Widespread N deficiency in surface waters fosters the occurrence and seasonal persistence of subsurface layers of maximum chlorophyll a (SCM) and phytoplankton carbon biomass in several sectors. The contribution of these layers to NPP is possibly higher in the Arctic than in thermally-stratified waters of the subtropical gyres due to a combination of extreme acclimation to low light and a shallow nitracline in the former. The overall impacts of SCM layers on biogeochemical fluxes remain to be quantified directly, both regionally and at the pan-Arctic scale. While CO2 intake by the Arctic Ocean should respond positively to reduced sea-ice extent, which facilitates air-sea exchange, the negative influence of rising temperatures and runoff on CO2 solubility might counteract the positive effect of modest PP increases in seasonally open waters. Overall, this review shows that local changes in light availability resulting from reduced sea-ice is only one factor in the intricate web of local and remote drivers of PP and CO2 drawdown in the Arctic Ocean. Understanding and predicting change requires an integrated biogeochemical approach that connects the small Arctic Ocean to adjacent ones and adequately resolves vertical nutrient supply processes at regional and local scales.},

Because even a single high-throughput experiment produces large amount of data, powerful statistical techniques of multivariate analysis are well suited to analyse and interpret these data sets. Many different multivariate techniques are available, and often it is not clear which method should be applied to a particular data set. In this review, we describe and compare the most widely used multivariate statistical techniques including exploratory, interpretive and discriminatory procedures. We consider several important limitations and assumptions of these methods, and we present examples of how these approaches have been utilized in recent studies to provide insight into the ecology of the microbial world.

	abstract = {Emission of the greenhouse gas methane from the seabed is globally controlled by marine aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs gaining energy via methane oxidation. However, the processes involved in the assembly and dynamics of methanotrophic populations in complex natural microbial communities remain unclear. Here we investigated the development of a methanotrophic microbiome following subsurface mud eruptions at H√•kon Mosby mud volcano (1250‚Äâm water depth). Freshly erupted muds hosted deep-subsurface communities that were dominated by Bathyarchaeota, Atribacteria and Chloroflexi. Methanotrophy was initially limited to a thin surface layer of Methylococcales populations consuming methane aerobically. With increasing distance to the eruptive center, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea, sulfate-reducing Desulfobacterales and thiotrophic Beggiatoaceae developed, and their respective metabolic capabilities dominated the biogeochemical functions of the community. Microbial richness, evenness, and cell numbers of the entire microbial community increased up to tenfold within a few years downstream of the mud flow from the eruptive center. The increasing diversity was accompanied by an up to fourfold increase in sequence abundance of relevant metabolic genes of the anaerobic methanotrophic and thiotrophic guilds. The communities fundamentally changed in their structure and functions as reflected in the metagenome turnover with distance from the eruptive center, and this was reflected in the biogeochemical zonation across the mud volcano caldera. The observed functional succession provides a framework for the response time and recovery of complex methanotrophic communities after disturbances of the deep-sea bed.},

Here we summarize and synthesize recent studies in the field of ecology, oceanography and ocean carbon cycling pertaining to possible feedbacks involving metabolic processes. By altering the rates of cellular growth and respiration, temperature-dependency may affect nutrient uptake and food demand in plankton and ultimately the equilibrium of pelagic food webs, with cascade effects on the flux of organic carbon between the upper and inner ocean (the ‚Äúbiological carbon pump‚Äù) and the global carbon cycle. Insights from modern ecology can be applied to investigate how temperature-dependent changes in ocean biogeochemical cycling over thousands to millions of years may have shaped the long-term evolution of Earth's climate and life.

Nitrogen oxides are intermediates of nitrification and denitrification and are released as terminal products under conditions such as high nitrogen load and low oxygen tension among other factors. The rapid completion and public availability of microbial genome sequences has revealed a high level of enzymatic redundancy in pathways terminating in nitrogen oxide metabolites, with few enzymes involved in returning nitrogen oxides to dinitrogen. The aerobic methanotrophic bacteria are particularly useful for discovering and analysing diverse mechanisms for nitrogen oxide production, as these microbes both nitrify (oxidize ammonia to nitrite) and denitrify (reduce nitrate/nitrite to nitrous oxide via nitric oxide), and yet do not rely on these pathways for growth. The fact that methanotrophs have a rich inventory for nitrogen oxide metabolism is, in part, a consequence of their evolutionary relatedness to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Furthermore, the ability of individual methanotrophic taxa to resist toxic intermediates of nitrogen metabolism affects the relative abundance of nitrogen oxides released into the environment, the composition of their community, and the balance between nitrogen and methane cycling.},

	abstract = {Large quantities of methane are stored in hydrates and permafrost within shallow marine sediments in the Arctic Ocean. These reservoirs are highly sensitive to climate warming, but the fate of methane released from sediments is uncertain. Here, we review the principal physical and biogeochemical processes that regulate methane fluxes across the seabed, the fate of this methane in the water column, and potential for its release to the atmosphere. We find that, at present, fluxes of dissolved methane are significantly moderated by anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of methane. If methane fluxes increase then a greater proportion of methane will be transported by advection or in the gas phase, which reduces the efficiency of the methanotrophic sink. Higher freshwater discharge to Arctic shelf seas may increase stratification and inhibit transfer of methane gas to surface waters, although there is some evidence that increased stratification may lead to warming of sub-pycnocline waters, increasing the potential for hydrate dissociation. Loss of sea-ice is likely to increase wind speeds and sea-air exchange of methane will consequently increase. Studies of the distribution and cycling of methane beneath and within sea ice are limited, but it seems likely that the sea-air methane flux is higher during melting in seasonally ice-covered regions. Our review reveals that increased observations around especially the anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of methane, bubble transport, and the effects of ice cover, are required to fully understand the linkages and feedback pathways between climate warming and release of methane from marine sediments.},

	abstract = {The Tommeliten seepage area is part of the Greater Ekofisk area, which is situated above the Tommeliten Delta salt diapir in the central North Sea (56¬∞29.90' N, 2¬∞59.80' E, Norwegian Block 1/9, 75 m water depth). Here, cracks in a buried marl horizon allow methane to migrate into overlying clay-silt and sandy sediments. Hydroacoustic sediment echosounding showed several venting spots coinciding with the apex of marl domes where methane is released into the water column and potentially to the atmosphere. In the vicinity of the gas seeps, sea floor observations showed small mats of giant sulphide-oxidizing bacteria above patches of black sediments as well as carbonate crusts, which are exposed 10 to 50 cm above seafloor forming small reefs. These Methane-Derived Authigenic Carbonates (MDACs) contain 13C-depleted, archaeal lipids indicating previous gas seepage and AOM activity. High amounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol and low abundances of biphytanes in the crusts give evidence that ANaerobic MEthane-oxidising archaea (ANME) of the phylogenetic cluster ANME-2 were the potential mediators of Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane (AOM) at the time of carbonate formation. Small pieces of MDACs were also found subsurface at about 1.7 m sediment depth, associated with the AOM zone. This zone is characterized by elevated AOM and Sulphate Reduction (SR) rates, increased concentrations of 13C-depleted tetraether derived biphytanes, and specific bacterial Fatty Acids (FA). Further biomarker and 16S rDNA based analyses of this horizon give evidence that AOM is mediated by archaea belonging to the ANME-1b group and Sulphate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) most likely belonging to the Seep-SRB1 cluster. The zone of active methane consumption was restricted to a distinct horizon of about 20 cm. Concentrations of 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers (e.g.¬†500 ng g-dw‚àí1 biphythanes, 140 ng g-dw‚àí1 fatty acid ai-C15:0), cell numbers (1.5√ó108 cells cm‚àí3), AOM and SR rates (3 nmol cm‚àí3 d‚àí1) in the Tommeliten AOM zone are 2‚Äì3 orders of magnitude lower compared to AOM zones of highly active deep water cold seeps such as Hydrate Ridge or the Gulf of Mexico.},

Recent investigations show that the number of active submarine mud volcanoes might be much higher than anticipated (for example, see refs 3‚Äì5), and that gas emitted from deep-sea seeps might reach the upper mixed ocean6,7,8. Unfortunately, global methane emission from active submarine mud volcanoes cannot be quantified because their number and gas release are unknown9. It is also unclear how efficiently methane-oxidizing microorganisms remove methane. Here we investigate the methane-emitting Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV, Barents Sea, 72¬∞ N, 14¬∞ 44‚Ä≤ E; 1,250 m water depth) to provide quantitative estimates of the in situ composition, distribution and activity of methanotrophs in relation to gas emission. The HMMV hosts three key communities: aerobic methanotrophic bacteria (Methylococcales), anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-2) thriving below siboglinid tubeworms, and a previously undescribed clade of archaea (ANME-3) associated with bacterial mats. We found that the upward flow of sulphate- and oxygen-free mud volcano fluids restricts the availability of these electron acceptors for methane oxidation, and hence the habitat range of methanotrophs. This mechanism limits the capacity of the microbial methane filter at active marine mud volcanoes to {\textless}40\% of the total flux.},

	abstract = {Major changes are occurring across the North Atlantic climate system, including in the atmosphere, ocean and cryosphere, and many observed changes are unprecedented in instrumental records. As the changes in the North Atlantic directly affect the climate and air quality of the surrounding continents, it is important to fully understand how and why the changes are taking place, not least to predict how the region will change in the future. To this end, this article characterizes the recent observed changes in the North Atlantic region, especially in the period 2005‚Äì2016, across many different aspects of the system including: atmospheric circulation; atmospheric composition; clouds and aerosols; ocean circulation and properties; and the cryosphere. Recent changes include: an increase in the speed of the North Atlantic jet stream in winter; a southward shift in the North Atlantic jet stream in summer, associated with a weakening summer North Atlantic Oscillation; increases in ozone and methane; increases in net absorbed radiation in the mid-latitude western Atlantic, linked to an increase in the abundance of high level clouds and a reduction in low level clouds; cooling of sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, concomitant with increases in the western subtropical gyre, and a decline in the Atlantic Ocean's overturning circulation; a decline in Atlantic sector Arctic sea ice and rapid melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet. There are many interactions between these changes, but these interactions are poorly understood. This article concludes by highlighting some of the key outstanding questions.},

Here, we investigated the relationship between FDOM sensors and DOC concentration in the lower Columbia River, USA in spring and summer 2013. Furthermore, we studied the seasonal variability of FDOM and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) optical indices, as well as the seasonal and spatial variability for the molecular characteristics of DOM using ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). The fieldwork was conducted concurrently with the operation of in situ sensor platforms that recorded physical and biogeochemical data at hourly intervals. In situ FDOM and DOC concentration was highly correlated and the relationship was used to quantify the river's DOC flux between March and August 2013.

EEM-PARAFAC identified four humic-like components and one protein-like component and the dynamics of each were evaluated based on their distribution with depth as well as across sites differing in hydrology and major biological species. The PARAFAC-EEM experiments were supported by dissolved organic carbon measurements (DOC), optical spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and compositional characterization by ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy (FT-ICR MS). The FT-ICR MS data indicate that metabolism in peatlands reduces the molecular weights of individual components of DOM, and oxygen-rich less aromatic molecules are selectively biodegraded. Our data suggest that different hydrologic and biological conditions within the larger peat ecosystem drive molecular changes in DOM, resulting in distinctly different chemical compositions and unique fluorescent fingerprints. PARAFAC modeling of EEM data coupled with ultrahigh resolution FT-ICR MS has the potential to provide significant molecular-based information on DOM composition that will support efforts to better understand the composition, sources, and diagenetic status of DOM from different terrestrial and aquatic systems.},

It is characterized by a permanent two layered counter-flow caused by the exchange of water masses between the Black and Mediterranean Seas. In this study we focus on the role of the Marmara Sea in altering the optical characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during its transport through the TSS. We use detailed absorbance and fluorescence measurements followed by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). PARAFAC identified four components: a primary terrestrial humic C1 (ex/em 255/448‚ÄØnm), a marine humic C2 (ex/em 300/402‚ÄØnm), a secondary terrestrial humic C3 (ex/em 280, 370/480‚ÄØnm) and a protein like component C4 (ex/em 275/336‚ÄØnm). The above halocline waters (‚â§25‚ÄØm) of Black Sea origin are characterized by high DOC (114‚Äì181‚ÄØŒºmol‚ÄØL‚àí1); high CDOM absorption (aCDOM(300): 1.97‚Äì2.92‚ÄØm‚àí1), low absorption spectral slope (S275‚Äì295: 0.0280‚Äì0.0307‚ÄØnm‚àí1) and high humic content. In this water layer, interrelationships with salinity, DOC and optical parameters revealed that although bulk DOC is diluted towards the west, transformations of the DOM pool are related to several processes. In the sub-halocline waters ({\textgreater}25‚Äì1250‚ÄØm) of Mediterranean origin, all measured parameters are significantly lower (DOC: 55‚Äì65‚ÄØŒºmo‚ÄØL‚àí1; aCDOM(300): 0.46‚Äì0.80‚ÄØm‚àí1; S275‚Äì295: 0.0241‚Äì0.0376‚ÄØnm‚àí1). No relationship of DOC with apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) could be established, likely due to the proliferation of particles. Nevertheless, qualitative changes of DOM could be traced by the negative relationship of S275‚Äì295 with AOU and the two fold increase of the intensities of the humic-like components towards the eastern part of the basin. This suggests that the optical signature of the Mediterranean DOM is altered in the deep Marmara Sea despite its constant DOC content.},

	abstract = {There is growing concern about the transfer of methane originating from water bodies to the atmosphere. Methane from sediments can reach the atmosphere directly via bubbles or indirectly via vertical turbulent transport. This work quantifies methane gas bubble dissolution using a combination of bubble modeling and acoustic observations of rising bubbles to determine what fraction of the methane transported by bubbles will reach the atmosphere. The bubble model predicts the evolving bubble size, gas composition, and rise distance and is suitable for almost all aquatic environments. The model was validated using methane and argon bubble dissolution measurements obtained from the literature for deep, oxic, saline water with excellent results. Methane bubbles from within the hydrate stability zone (typically below ‚àº500 m water depth in the ocean) are believed to form an outer hydrate rim. To explain the subsequent slow dissolution, a model calibration was performed using bubble dissolution data from the literature measured within the hydrate stability zone. The calibrated model explains the impressively tall flares ({\textgreater}1300 m) observed in the hydrate stability zone of the Black Sea. This study suggests that only a small amount of methane reaches the surface at active seep sites in the Black Sea, and this only from very shallow water areas ({\textless}100 m). Clearly, the Black Sea and the ocean are rather effective barriers against the transfer of bubble methane to the atmosphere, although substantial amounts of methane may reach the surface in shallow lakes and reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Large amounts of the greenhouse gas methane are released from the seabed to the water column1, where it may be consumed by aerobic methanotrophic bacteria2. The size and activity of methanotrophic communities, which determine the amount of methane consumed in the water column, are thought to be mainly controlled by nutrient and redox dynamics3,4,5,6,7. Here, we report repeated measurements of methanotrophic activity and community size at methane seeps west of Svalbard, and relate them to physical water mass properties and modelled ocean currents. We show that cold bottom water, which contained a large number of aerobic methanotrophs, was displaced by warmer water with a considerably smaller methanotrophic community within days. Ocean current simulations using a global ocean/sea-ice model suggest that this water mass exchange is consistent with short-term variations in the meandering West Spitsbergen Current. We conclude that the shift from an offshore to a nearshore position of the current can rapidly and severely reduce methanotrophic activity in the water column. Strong fluctuating currents are common at many methane seep systems globally, and we suggest that they affect methane oxidation in the water column at other sites, too.},

	abstract = {One carbon (C1) metabolism plays an important role in marine carbon cycling but the dynamics and modes of C1 transformations are not fully understood. We made contemporaneous measurements of methylamine and methanol metabolism to elucidate the role of C1 compounds as sources of carbon, energy, and nitrogen. Methanol and methylamine were predominantly used as an energy source in offshore waters (oxidation rate constant: kmethanol: 0.02 d‚àí1‚àí0.10 d‚àí1; kmethylamine: 0.01 d‚àí1‚àí0.18 d‚àí1), but were also important sources of biomass carbon in coastal waters (assimilation rate constant: kmethanol: 0.01 d‚àí1‚àí0.10 d‚àí1; kmethylamine: 0.01 d‚àí1‚àí0.05 d‚àí1). The relative extent of assimilation versus oxidation for these substrates correlated positively with chlorophyll, nutrients, and heterotrophic bacterial production. Methanol oxidation and assimilation were stimulated significantly by nutrient addition. In contrast, methylamine metabolism was inhibited by ammonium or nitrate, suggesting that methylamine served as a nitrogen source. A preliminary metagenomic survey revealed a diverse population of putative C1-utilizing microorganisms. These results show that the remineralization of methylamine could provide both C and N sources for microbes. Both methanol and methylamine contribute to microbial energetic and carbon substrate demands with a distinctly different signature in nearshore versus offshore environments.

This work evaluated the use of electrospray ionization in both negative ion mode (ESI‚àí) and positive ion mode (ESI+) for the characterization of DOM extracted from nine terrestrial sources using Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). The compositing of the peaks from ESI‚àí to ESI+ modes increased the total assigned formulas from 23 to 63 \% as compared to the traditional use of ESI‚àí alone for DOM characterization. In general, there was a preferential increase in the number of assignments for the aliphatic and carbohydrate-like DOM components in the ESI+ mode. The soil-extracted DOM specifically exhibited greater increases in the aliphatic and carbohydrate-like DOM components with the combined use of ESI‚àí and ESI+ modes likely due to the greater presence of aromatic DOM molecules that suppressed the ionization of these entities in ESI‚àí mode. On the basis of these findings, we show that improved characterization of DOM is possible through the combined use of ESI‚àí and ESI+ modes for FT-ICR-MS analysis, especially for samples rich in condensed aromatic and aromatic molecules.},

Ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), excitation emission matrix fluorescence (EEM) spectroscopy, and molecular lignin analysis techniques were used to study this DOM. The analysis revealed a group of compounds found only in the coastal DOM samples, which were also characterized by an elevated terrestrial DOM fluorescence pattern and elevated lignin content if compared to the offshore samples. This group exhibited a high degree of carbon unsaturation, as evident from high double bond equivalence minus oxygen values (DBE-O{\textgreater}9) and maximum fluorescence intensity. Sulfur-containing molecular formulae for summer DOM samples were much more abundant across the entire transect of the STC compared to winter and exhibited distinctly different hydrogen:carbon and oxygen:carbon elemental ratios, suggesting a possible correlation between biological activity and sulfur compounds. The molecular formulae common to all STC samples were compared with those calculated for DOM extracted from freshwater collected from a stream discharging into Doubtful Sound (West Coast, New Zealand). ESI-FT-ICR-MS measurements undertaken in negative electrospray ionization (ESI‚àí) mode indicated that 30\% of the molecular formulae were present in both types of DOM, while in positive ESI mode (ESI+) over 90\% of the formulae were present in all samples. Hence, a significant portion of the molecular formulae assigned to the solid-phase extractable DOM pool (SPE-DOM) appear to be identical in oceanic and freshwater samples.},

The strong inflow of saline, but chilled Atlantic Water during the early Holocene was followed by cooling and freshening of the bottom waters during the mid- and late Holocene. The two records reveal synchronous oceanographic changes that are closely tied to changes in the flow of Atlantic Water recorded further south in the Nordic seas. The early Holocene warming was not just an effect of higher solar insolation, but was also due to increased heat flux from the stronger Atlantic Water inflow driven by wind force and/or thermohaline circulation.},

	abstract = {We present estimates of volume and heat transport through Fram Strait for the period 1997 to 2000 from data of moored instruments. The annual mean volume transports at 78¬∞55‚Ä≤N were between 9 2 and 10 1 Sv northward and 13 2 and 12 1 Sv southward with a net transport between 4 2 and 2 2 Sv to the south. The temperature of the northward flow of Atlantic Water had a strong seasonality with a minimum in winter. Nevertheless, the northward heat transport was highest in winter caused by the winter maximum of northward volume transport. Between 1997 and 1999, the annual mean net heat transport across 78¬∞55‚Ä≤N increased from 16 12 to 41 5 TW. This resulted from a very strong increase in heat transport in the West Spitsbergen Current (mean annual values from 28 5 to 44 6 TW and to 46 5 TW in 99/00) which was not compensated by an equivalent signal in the southward flow. The heat transport to the south remained constant within error limitations. Only half of the heat flux increase in the West Spitsbergen Current was due to a higher temperature; half of it was due to a stronger flow. A similar increase as observed between 1997 and 2000 would have been sufficient to explain the warming of intermediate layers in the Eurasian Arctic observed in the early 1990s. Consequently, we suggest that a warming signal from the late 1990s is presently spreading in the interior Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {The water mass distribution in northern Fram Strait and over the Yermak Plateau in summer 1997 is described using CTD data from two cruises in the area. The West Spitsbergen Current was found to split, one part recirculated towards the west, while the other part, on entering the Arctic Ocean separated into two branches. The main inflow of Atlantic Water followed the Svalbard continental slope eastward, while a second, narrower, branch stayed west and north of the Yermak Plateau. The water column above the southeastern flank of the Yermak Plateau was distinctly colder and less saline than the two inflow branches. Immediately west of the outer inflow branch comparatively high temperatures in the Atlantic Layer suggested that a part of the extraordinarily warm Atlantic Water, observed in the boundary current in the Eurasian Basin in the early 1990s, was now returning, within the Eurasian Basin, toward Fram Strait. The upper layer west of the Yermak Plateau was cold, deep and comparably saline, similar to what has recently been observed in the interior Eurasian Basin. Closer to the Greenland continental slope the salinity of the upper layer became much lower, and the temperature maximum of the Atlantic Layer was occasionally below 0.5 ¬∞C, indicating water masses mainly derived from the Canadian Basin. This implies that the warm pulse of Atlantic Water had not yet made a complete circuit around the Arctic Ocean. The Atlantic Water of the West Spitsbergen Current recirculating within the strait did not extend as far towards Greenland as in the 1980s, leaving a broader passage for waters from the Atlantic and intermediate layers, exiting the Arctic Ocean. A possible interpretation is that the circulation pattern alternates between a strong recirculation of the West Spitsbergen Current in the strait, and a larger exchange of Atlantic Water between the Nordic Seas and the inner parts of the Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {Dense water masses from Arctic shelf seas are an important part of the Arctic thermohaline system. We present previously unpublished observations from shallow banks in the Barents Sea, which reveal large interannual variability in dense water temperature and salinity. To examine the formation and circulation of dense water, and the processes governing interannual variability, a regional coupled ice-ocean model is applied to the Barents Sea for the period 1948‚Äì2007. Volume and characteristics of dense water are investigated with respect to the initial autumn surface salinity, atmospheric cooling, and sea-ice growth (salt flux). In the southern Barents Sea (Spitsbergen Bank and Central Bank) dense water formation is associated with advection of Atlantic Water into the Barents Sea and corresponding variations in initial salinities and heat loss at the air‚Äìsea interface. The characteristics of the dense water on the Spitsbergen Bank and Central Bank are thus determined by the regional climate of the Barents Sea. Preconditioning is also important to dense water variability on the northern banks, and can be related to local ice melt (Great Bank) and properties of the Novaya Zemlya Coastal Current (Novaya Zemlya Bank). The dense water mainly exits the Barents Sea between Frans Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya, where it constitutes 63\% (1.2Sv) of the net outflow and has an average density of 1028.07kgm‚àí3. An amount of 0.4Sv enters the Arctic Ocean between Svalbard and Frans Josef Land. Covering 9\% of the ocean area, the banks contribute with approximately 1/3 of the exported dense water. Formation on the banks is more important when the Barents Sea is in a cold state (less Atlantic Water inflow, more sea-ice). During warm periods with high throughflow more dense water is produced broadly over the shelf by general cooling of the northward flowing Atlantic Water. However, our results indicate that during extremely warm periods (1950s and late 2000s) the total export of dense water to the Arctic Ocean becomes strongly reduced.},

	abstract = {The focus of this work is on the temporal and spatial variability of the Atlantic Water (AW). We analyze the existing historic hydrographic data from the World Ocean Database to document the long-term variability of the AW throughflow across the Norwegian Sea to the western Barents Sea. Interannual-to-multidecadal variability of water temperature, salinity and density are analyzed along six composite sections crossing the AW flow and coastal currents at six selected locations. The stations are lined up from southwest to northeast ‚Äì from the northern North Sea (69¬∞N) throughout the Norwegian Sea to the Kola Section in the Barents Sea (33¬∞30‚Ä≤E). The changing volume and characteristics of the AW throughflow dominate the hydrographic variability on decadal and longer time scales in the studied area. We examine the role of fluctuations of the volume of inflow versus the variable local factors, such as the air‚Äìsea interaction and mixing with the fresh coastal and cold Arctic waters, in controlling the long-term regional variability. It is shown that the volume of the AW, passing through the area and affecting the position of the outer edge of the warm and saline core, correlates well with temperature and salinity averaged over the central portions of the studied sections. The coastal flow (mostly associated with the Norwegian Coastal Current flowing over the continental shelf) is largely controlled by seasonal local heat and freshwater impacts. Temperature records at all six lines show a warming trend superimposed on a series of relatively warm and cold periods, which in most cases follow, with a delay of four to five years, the periods of relatively low and high North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the periods of relatively high and low Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), respectively. In general, there is a relatively high correlation between the year-to-year changes of the NAO and AMO indices, which is to some extent reflected in the (delayed) AW temperature fluctuations. It takes about two years for freshening and salinification events and a much shorter time (of about a year or less) for cooling and warming episodes to propagate or spread across the region. This significant difference in the propagation rates of salinity and temperature anomalies is explained by the leading role of horizontal advection in the propagation of salinity anomalies, whereas temperature is also controlled by the competing air‚Äìsea interaction along the AW throughflow. Therefore, although a water parcel moves within the flow as a whole, the temperature, salinity and density anomalies split and propagate separately, with the temperature and density signals leading relative to the salinity signal. A new hydrographic index, coastal-to-offshore density step, is introduced to capture variability in the strength of the AW volume transport. This index shows the same cycles of variability as observed in temperature, NAO and AMO but without an obvious trend.},

	abstract = {Observational data have been collected during a cruise to the western Barents Sea in March 2014 covering 33 stations along three west‚Äìeast sections at 76.34¬∞N, 77.26¬∞N and 78.49¬∞N and along one south‚Äìnorth section at 19.47¬∞E. Our observations suggest a wedge-like water masses structure with colder and fresher Arctic Water moving southward, gliding over warmer and more saline Atlantic Water which below the surface moves to the north. Atlantic Water in the Storfjorden Trench reached farther north than 76.5¬∞N and was present on the eastern and western slopes of the Spitsbergen Bank. Our measurements indicate limited dense water formation in the Storfjorden. A comparison with historical data over the years 1923‚Äì2011 reveal an anomalous northern location of the Polar Front for this time of the year in March 2014. A point by point comparison with ten historical stations in 1983 and 1986 shows significantly warmer (by up to 3.8¬∞C) and saltier (by up to 2.49psu) conditions in 2014 for nine out of ten stations. Moreover, stations dominated by the Atlantic inflow experienced the largest changes, whereas in stations located in the area of the Arctic outflow the changes were smallest. Furthermore, we used satellite and decadal reanalysis data to estimate the climate variability defined by a range of two standard deviations. We found that in the Storfjorden Trench in March 2014 the water transport was within the range, while the water temperature exceeded the upper limit of climate variability. The sea ice extent in the western Barents Sea was below the lower limit of climate variability from mid-February to mid-March 2014. Combining in situ, satellite and model data, we were able to attribute the warm anomaly observed in March 2014 to two main reasons: (1) an increase of Atlantic water temperature which was evident already in the beginning of 2014 and (2) very little cooling in February and March 2014. From these results we conclude that the north-western Barents Sea is a key region to monitor local response on climate change signals in the Arctic Ocean.},

This study concentrated on the frontal region between Bj√∏rn√∏ya and Hopen Island where Arctic water is found on the Spitsbergen Bank and Atlantic water in the Bear Island Trough and Hopen Trench. The distributions of Atlantic and Arctic waters in relation to topography were consistent with the hypothesis that the location of the polar front is fixed at about the 250 m isobath by the barotropic circulation of Atlantic water within the Bear Island Trough and Hopen Trench. In winter, vertical gradients of temperature and salinity were weak throughout the frontal region, consistent with a barotropic, topographically controlled front. In summer, vertical gradients remained weak below 100 m depth but increased in the upper layer as a result of the presence of fresh, warm surface water produced by melting ice. The topographic control of thermohaline properties at the surface was disrupted by the meltwater pool, and the meltwater contributed to water mass modification in the frontal region. The following seasonal cycle of water mass formation was hypothesized: Summer heating melts the sea ice on the Spitsbergen Bank and produces the surface meltwater pool. This meltwater not only increases vertical thermohaline gradients on the bank but also crosses the front and freshens the surface layer throughout the western Barents Sea. Subsequent winter cooling, which creates ice over the bank, also forms dense water in the Bear Island Trough and Hopen Trench by convective mixing of Atlantic water and the overlying meltwater.},

	abstract = {Methane is a major greenhouse gas linked to global warming; however, patterns of in situ methane oxidation by methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs), nature's main biological mechanism for methane suppression, are often inconsistent with laboratory predictions. For example, one would expect a strong relationship between methanotroph ecology and Cu level because methanotrophs require Cu to sustain particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), the most efficient enzyme for methane oxidation. However, no correlation has been observed in nature, which is surprising because methane monooxygenase (MMO) gene expression has been unequivocally linked to Cu availability. Here we provide a fundamental explanation for this lack of correlation. We propose that MMO expression in nature is largely controlled by solid-phase Cu geochemistry and the relative ability of Cu acquisition systems in methanotrophs, such as methanobactins (mb), to obtain Cu from mineral sources. To test this hypothesis, RT-PCR expression assays were developed for Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (which produces mb) to quantify pMMO, soluble MMO (the alternate MMO expressed when Cu is ‚Äúunavailable‚Äù), and 16S-rRNA gene expression under progressively more stringent Cu supply conditions. When Cu was provided as CuCl2, pMMO transcript levels increased significantly consistent with laboratory work. However, when Cu was provided as Cu-doped iron oxide, pMMO transcript levels increased only when mb was also present. Finally, when Cu was provided as Cu-doped borosilicate glass, pMMO transcription patterns varied depending on the ambient mb:Cu supply ratio. Cu geochemistry clearly influences MMO expression in terrestrial systems, and, as such, local Cu mineralogy might provide an explanation for methane oxidation patterns in the natural environment.},

	abstract = {Climate models project that the Arctic Ocean may experience ice-free summers already in the second half of this century. This may have severe repercussions on phytoplankton bloom dynamics and the associated cycling of carbon in surface waters. We currently lack baseline knowledge of the seasonal dynamics of Arctic microbial communities, which is needed in order to better estimate the effects of such changes on ecosystem functioning. Here we present a comparative study of polar summer microbial communities in the ice-free (eastern) and ice-covered (western) hydrographic regimes at the LTER HAUSGARTEN in Fram Strait, the main gateway between the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans. Based on measured and modeled biogeochemical parameters, we tentatively identified two different ecosystem states (i.e., different phytoplankton bloom stages) in the distinct regions. Using Illumina tag-sequencing, we determined the community composition of both free-living and particle-associated bacteria as well as microbial eukaryotes in the photic layer. Despite substantial horizontal mixing by eddies in Fram Strait, pelagic microbial communities showed distinct differences between the two regimes, with a proposed early spring (pre-bloom) community in the ice-covered western regime (with higher representation of SAR11, SAR202, SAR406 and eukaryotic MALVs) and a community indicative of late summer conditions (post-bloom) in the ice-free eastern regime (with higher representation of Flavobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and eukaryotic heterotrophs). Co-occurrence networks revealed specific taxon-taxon associations between bacterial and eukaryotic taxa in the two regions. Our results suggest that the predicted changes in sea-ice cover and phytoplankton bloom dynamics will have a strong impact on bacterial community dynamics and potentially on biogeochemical cycles in this region.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is the main limiting nutrient for biological production in the Arctic Ocean. While dissolved inorganic N (DIN) is well studied, the substantial pool of N bound in organic matter (OM) and its bioavailability in the system is rarely considered. Covering a full annual cycle, we here follow N and carbon (C) content in particulate (P) and dissolved (D) OM within the Atlantic water inflow to the Arctic Ocean. While POC, PON, and DOC accumulated in the surface waters from January to May, the DON-pool decreased substantially (Œî - 50 ¬µg N L-1). The DON reduction was greater than the simultaneous reduction in DIN (Œî - 30 ¬µg N L-1), demonstrating that DON is a valuable N-source supporting the growing biomass. While the accumulating POM had a C/N ratio close to Redfield, the asynchronous accumulation of C and N in the dissolved pool resulted in a drastic increase in the C/N ratio of DOM during the spring bloom. This is likely due to a combination of the reduction in DON, and a high release of carbon-rich sugars from phytoplankton, as 32\% of the spring primary production was dissolved. Our findings thus caution calculations of particulate primary production from DIN drawdown. During post-bloom the DON pool increased 3-fold due to an enhanced microbial processing of organic matter and reduced phytoplankton production. The light absorption spectra of DOM revealed high absorption within the UV range during spring bloom indicating DOM with low molecular weight in this period. The ‚Äòspring CDOM signal‚Äô was not present in August and absorption in the winter months was low. Our results demonstrate that the change in ecosystem function (i.e. phytoplankton species and activity, bacterial activity and grazing) in different seasons is associated with strong changes in the C/N ratios and optical character of DOM and underpin the essential role of DON for the production cycle in the Arctic.},

	abstract = {Multiple proxies in the geological record offshore NW Svalbard track shallow subseafloor diagenesis and seafloor methane seepage during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) extent and the disintegration of the Svalbard Barents Sea Ice Sheet (SBIS). Vestnesa Ridge, located at 79¬∞N and in 1200‚ÄØm water depth, is one of the northernmost known active methane seep sites and is characterised by a subseafloor fluid flow system, numerous seafloor pockmarks and gas flares in the water column. In this study, we develop a Late Pleistocene and Holocene stratigraphic framework, use stable oxygen and carbon isotope signatures (Œ¥18O, Œ¥13C) of benthic and planktic foraminifera, the mineralogical and carbon isotope composition of methane-derived authigenic carbonate (MDAC) and sediment geochemical data of ten sediment cores to assess methane seepage variability on Vestnesa Ridge. The studied cores cover the age range between 31.9 and 10‚ÄØcal ka BP and record 32 negative Œ¥13C excursions in benthic and planktic foraminifera with amplitudes down to¬†‚àí29 ‚Ä∞ VPDB. These Œ¥13C excursions are often associated with elevated Ca/Ti and Sr/Ti elemental ratios in sediments and MDAC nodules. The precipitation of MDAC overgrowth on foraminiferal tests explains most of the negative Œ¥13C excursions. In this dataset, the oldest recorded methane emission episodes on Vestnesa Ridge occurred between the LGM (24‚Äì23.5‚ÄØcal ka BP) and Heinrich Event 1 (HE 1; 17.7‚Äì16.8‚ÄØcal ka BP). Geological indicators for past subseafloor methane cycling and seafloor methane seepage, such as negative foraminiferal Œ¥13C excursions, MDAC nodules, and elevated Sr/Ti elemental ratios recorded in post-LGM sediments, possibly represent vertical migration of the sulphate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) and post-date sedimentation by up to 13.4 ka. However, it is important to note that indications of post-LGM seafloor methane seepage at Vestnesa Ridge also correspond to the established methane efflux chronology for the adjacent Barents Sea shelf, implying that glacio-isostatic adjustments and associated re-activation of pre-existing deep-seated faults after disintegration of the SBIS are likely important controlling factors on fluid migration towards the seafloor.},

	abstract = {The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is an important sink of methane that plays a significant role in global warming. AOM was first found to be coupled with sulfate reduction and mediated by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). ANME, often forming consortia with SRB, are phylogenetically related to methanogenic archaea. ANME-1 is even able to produce methane. Subsequently, it has been found that AOM can also be coupled with denitrification. The known microbes responsible for this process are Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera (M. oxyfera) and Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens (M. nitroreducens). Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera belongs to the NC10 bacteria, can catalyze nitrite reduction through an ‚Äúintra-aerobic‚Äù pathway, and may catalyze AOM through an aerobic methane oxidation pathway. However, M. nitroreducens, which is affiliated with ANME-2d archaea, may be able to catalyze AOM through the reverse methanogenesis pathway. Moreover, manganese (Mn4+) and iron (Fe3+) can also be used as electron acceptors of AOM. This review summarizes the mechanisms and associated microbes of AOM. It also discusses recent progress in some unclear key issues about AOM, including ANME-1 in hypersaline environments, the effect of oxygen on M. oxyfera, and the relationship of M. nitroreducens with ANME.},

Here we report a methane efflux chronology from five sites, at depths of 220‚Äì400 m, in the southwest Barents and Norwegian seas where grounded ice sheets led to thickening of the gas hydrate stability zone during the last glaciation. The onset of methane release was coincident with deglaciation-induced pressure release and thinning of the hydrate stability zone. Methane efflux continued for 7‚Äì10 kyr, tracking hydrate stability changes controlled by relative sea-level rise, bottom water warming and fluid pathway evolution in response to changing stress fields. The protracted nature of seafloor methane emissions probably attenuated the impact of hydrate dissociation on the climate system.},

	abstract = {Although the majority of known autotrophs use the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle for carbon fixation, all currently described autotrophs from the Campylobacterota (previously Epsilonproteobacteria) use the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle (rTCA) instead. We discovered campylobacterotal epibionts ("Candidatus Thiobarba") of deep-sea mussels that have acquired a complete CBB cycle and lost key genes of the rTCA cycle. Intriguingly, the phylogenies of campylobacterotal CBB genes suggest they were acquired in multiple transfers from Gammaproteobacteria closely related to sulfur-oxidizing endosymbionts associated with the mussels, as well as from Betaproteobacteria. We hypothesize that "Ca. Thiobarba" switched from the rTCA to a fully functional CBB cycle during its evolution, by acquiring genes from multiple sources, including co-occurring symbionts. We also found key CBB cycle genes in free-living Campylobacterota, suggesting that the CBB cycle may be more widespread in this phylum than previously known. Metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics confirmed high expression of CBB cycle genes in mussel-associated "Ca.  Thiobarba". Direct stable isotope fingerprinting showed that "Ca. Thiobarba" has typical CBB signatures, additional evidence that it uses this cycle for carbon fixation. Our discovery calls into question current assumptions about the distribution of carbon fixation pathways across the tree of life, and the interpretation of stable isotope measurements in the environment.},

	abstract = {Summary
Two Spitsbergen fjords, Hornsund and Kongsfjorden, are known for being under different hydrological regimes. The first is cold, separated from warm Atlantic water by East Spitsbergen Current, while Kongsfjorden is frequently penetrated by relatively warm Atlantic water. On the other hand, both are under strong influence of water discharge from glaciers and land freshwater input. During the period of observation in both fjords a dominant water mass was Surface Water, which originates mainly from glacial melt. The presence of suspended matter introduced with melt water in Surface Water is reflected by highest values of light attenuation and absorption coefficients recorded in areas close to glacier both in Hornsund and Kongsfjorden. In Hornsund the maximum light attenuation coefficient cpg(555) was 5.817m‚àí1 and coefficient of light absorption by particles ap(676)=0.10m‚àí1. In Kongsfjorden the corresponding values were 26.5m‚àí1 and 0.223m‚àí1. In Kongsfjorden suspended matter of the size class 20‚Äì200Œºm dominated over fractions smaller than 20Œºm while in Hornsund dominating size fraction was 2‚Äì20Œºm. The results provide an evidence of considerable range of variability of the optical properties mainly due to glacial and riverine runoff. The scale of variability of particulate matter in Kongsfjorden is bigger than in Hornsund. Most of the variability in Hornsund can be attributed to glaciers discharge and a presence of particles of mineral origin, while in Kongsfjorden the organic and mineral particles contribute almost equally to defining the optical properties of water.},

In this study, a total of 867 paired CDOM absorption spectra (n=1734) from different ecosystems (lakes, streams, sewages and estuaries) were measured on 0.2Œºm and GF/F (nominal pore size 0.7Œºm) filters. The aims were to evaluate how fine organic particles influence the spectral signature of the DOM pool and to quantify the effects of choice of filter type. In aquatic ecosystems influenced by terrestrial DOM (rivers and lakes), the dissolved fraction (here defined as {\textless}0.2Œºm) overwhelmed the fine particulate signal (0.2‚Äì0.7Œºm) which did not contribute significantly to the absorption signal. In contrast, freshly-produced fine particles released by phytoplankton significantly increased measured CDOM absorption in productive environments with low terrestrial background. Our results demonstrate that the choice of filter pore size can have a significant impact on the outcome of spectral metrics often used to characterise CDOM such as the spectral slope (S) or the slope ratio (SR). Hence, this may complicate the combining of CDOM absorption measurements from different studies where different pore sizes were used as fine particulate material may significantly influence the spectral signature, particularly in situations where phytoplankton is the dominating source of DOM.},

The molecular size of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) was consistently higher than that of fluorescent DOM (FDOM), with an average difference of 0.37 kDa. The relative abundance of FDOM vs. CDOM ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 across lakes, and increased with decreasing average molecular size. Across sites, the CDOM spectral slopes of the large molecular size fraction were highly similar while the low molecular size fraction differed and contributed to different bulk spectral slopes. Our results indicate structural congruence of high molecular size DOM across systems while lake trophic status determined the characteristics of the low size range. Furthermore, the combination of HPSEC and parallel factor analysis (HPSEC-PARAFAC2) allowed the decomposition of DOM fluorescence chromatograms. Three humic-like components and one protein-like component with broadly overlapping molecular size distributions were identified. This overlap provides further evidence for the supramolecular assembly hypothesis since fluorophores, as revealed by PARAFAC2, occur in aggregates of overlapping molecular size. Our results further suggest a link between the molecular size of these fluorophores and the associated supramolecular assemblies. This study demonstrates the potential for HPSEC and novel mathematical approaches to provide unprecedented insights into the relationship between optical and chemical properties of DOM in aquatic systems.},

The most recalcitrant fractions have mean radiocarbon ages of 4,000 years in the Atlantic to 6,000 years in the Pacific. Knowing the radiocarbon signatures of DOC and the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is crucial to develop understanding of the persistence and lifetime of the DOC pool. In this research, we collected samples from the deep North Pacific in August 2013 (aboard the RV Melville) to couple the Œî14C content of solid-phase-extracted DOM (Œî14C-SPE-DOM) with its molecular composition in the ocean's oldest deep waters. We find that deep waters in this region held a mean Œî14C-SPE-DOM value of ‚àí554 ¬± 9‚Ä∞ ( 6,400 14C years), substantially more depleted than that in the deep Atlantic, which held a mean Œî14C-SPE-DOM value of ‚àí445 ¬± 5‚Ä∞. While we find a more degraded molecular composition of DOM in the deep Pacific than the deep Atlantic, the molecular formulae within the Island of Stability (Lechtenfeld et al., 2014, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2013.11.009), are largely retained. These results imply that a fraction of deep DOM is resistant to removal and present in both the deep Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.},

	abstract = {Methane (CH4) is produced in many natural systems that are vulnerable to change under a warming climate, yet current CH4 budgets, as well as future shifts in CH4 emissions, have high uncertainties. Climate change has the potential to increase CH4 emissions from critical systems such as wetlands, marine and freshwater systems, permafrost, and methane hydrates, through shifts in temperature, hydrology, vegetation, landscape disturbance, and sea level rise. Increased CH4 emissions from these systems would in turn induce further climate change, resulting in a positive climate feedback. Here we synthesize biological, geochemical, and physically focused CH4 climate feedback literature, bringing together the key findings of these disciplines. We discuss environment-specific feedback processes, including the microbial, physical, and geochemical interlinkages and the timescales on which they operate, and present the current state of knowledge of CH4 climate feedbacks in the immediate and distant future. The important linkages between microbial activity and climate warming are discussed with the aim to better constrain the sensitivity of the CH4 cycle to future climate predictions. We determine that wetlands will form the majority of the CH4 climate feedback up to 2100. Beyond this timescale, CH4 emissions from marine and freshwater systems and permafrost environments could become more important. Significant CH4 emissions to the atmosphere from the dissociation of methane hydrates are not expected in the near future. Our key findings highlight the importance of quantifying whether CH4 consumption can counterbalance CH4 production under future climate scenarios.},

	abstract = {The ocean continental shelves host the largest global reservoir of methane (CH4). Despite the great extent of these CH4 reservoirs, much of the CH4 released into deep ocean environments appear to dissolve in seawater prior to atmospheric emission. Once dissolved in ocean water, the CH4 emitted can be aerobically oxidized and converted into either carbon dioxide (CO2) or biomass. While hypotheses have been levied suggesting that the CO2 produced from aerobic methane oxidation could enhance ocean acidification, no empirical research has been performed to confirm or refute this hypothesis. The work presented here investigates local changes in seawater-dissolved CO2 and pH in a region that is experiencing active CH4 seepage near the upper stability boundary of methane clathrate hydrates. We show that in an area of elevated CH4 concentrations and aerobic oxidation rates, Hudson Canyon, aerobic CH4 oxidation is only responsible for 0.3 ¬± 0.2\% of the observed change in dissolved inorganic carbon. Measurements further show that the remineralization of both old marine and young terrestrial organic carbon is contributing more substantially to the observed changes. While this investigation did not investigate chronic, multiyear changes in ocean acidification due to CH4 oxidation, these results suggest that over short timescales, CH4 oxidation in seep fields does not have an acute influence on seawater pH.},

CH4 oxidation rates were measured in the field throughout the growing season during three sampling times at eight different sampling points in combination with laboratory incubation experiments.

These seeps represent a compelling opportunity to compare and contrast geochemical parameters, as well as the distribution and composition of associated chemosynthetic ecosystems, across geologically distinct seeps. Specifically, this study characterized the physical, chemical, geological, and biological features at Veatch Canyon, New England, and Shallop Canyon methane seep sites using a suite of state-of-the-art sampling and communication tools: AUV Sentry, HOV Alvin, a video-equipped multicore, and a real-time telepresence connection to the Inner Space Center (ISC) at the University of Rhode Island. Water column backscatter data collected by AUV Sentry confirmed previously detected gas emission and further indicated the presence of 13 actively emitting gas seeps within the Veatch Canyon survey area, 5 within the New England survey area, and 15 within the Shallop Canyon survey area. Complementary high-resolution seafloor bathymetry and backscatter mapping data indicated highly rugose morphology at all surveyed seep sites including the presence of extensive rock outcrops and bivalve beds. Video collected by HOV Alvin provided visual confirmation of gas plumes and the presence of chemosynthetic communities, including microbial mats and mussel beds, as well as large outcrops of authigenic carbonate rock surrounding locations of discrete gas emission. Bathymodiolus was the dominant species observed at the Veatch Canyon methane seep site, while the deep-sea red crab, Chaceon quinquedens, dominated the New England and Shallop Canyon seep sites. Elevated pore water sulfide concentrations suggested stimulation of sulfate-coupled anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and/or degradation of organic matter in seep sediments relative to non-seep sediments; AOM was observed directly within overlying authigenic carbonate rocks. DNA sequencing of the surface sediments revealed diverse sulfide-oxidizing bacteria similar to the taxa described previously at other methane seeps, including members of the Thiotrichales and Campylobacterales. Together, these analyses provide one of the first interdisciplinary descriptions of sites within this massive seep system, setting the stage for more targeted, hypothesis-driven investigations. In this context, telepresence facilitated interdisciplinary research between specialists at the ISC and scientists and engineers at sea, enabling researchers to transfer data and maximize research efforts with sampling tools at sea. Our findings suggest that although the geological setting is distinct, the surficial microbial and macrofaunal communities closely resemble those of previously described methane seeps.},

	abstract = {The spatial and seasonal magnitude and variability of primary production in the Arctic Ocean (AO) is quantified with a pan-arctic approach. We synthesize estimates of primary production (PP), focusing on surface waters (0‚Äì5m), using complementary methods that emphasize different spatial and temporal scales. These methods include (1) in situ observations of 14C uptake mostly and possibly some O2 production reported in units of carbon (in situ PP), (2) remotely sensed primary production (sat-PP), and (3) an empirical algorithm giving net PP as a function of in situ chlorophyll a (in situ Chl-PP). The work presented herein examines historical data for PP collected in surface waters only, as they form the majority of the values of a larger ensemble of PP data collected over {\textgreater}50years (ARCSS-PP) by many national and international efforts. This extended set of surface and vertically-resolved data will provide pan-Arctic validation of remotely sensed chlorophyll a and PP, an extremely valuable tool in this environment which is so difficult to sample. To this day, PP data in the AO are scarce and have uneven temporal and spatial coverage which, when added to the AO‚Äôs regional heterogeneity, its strong seasonal changes, and limited access, have made and continue to make obtaining a comprehensive picture of PP in the AO difficult. Daily surface in situ PP averaged 70 and 21mgCm‚àí3d‚àí1 for spring and summer, respectively, for the ca. 50year period across the AO. Average daily estimates of in situ PP in surface waters on a pan-Arctic basis were several fold higher with respect to remotely sensed PP (sat-PP) and in situ chlorophyll-derived PP (Chl-PP) in the spring period, likely due to differences in data availability and coverage. Summer daily averages for surface in situ PP and sat-PP were similar and twice as high as in situ Chl-PP. Differences among annual estimates of surface in situ PP, in situ Chl-PP and sat-PP across the Arctic Ocean are presented and discussed. The mode of all three differences was 0mg Cm‚àí3y‚àí1 and the median difference was within ¬±400mgCm‚àí3y‚àí1. Agreement between annual surface sat-PP and in situ PP was within ¬±1000mgCm‚àí3y‚àí1 for half of the data. We hope that the entire ARCSS-PP data set, especially if combined with any archiving by the latest IPY effort, will be employed to develop an improved, panarctic-specific PP remote sensing algorithm and to test hypotheses regarding the controls of PP in the AO. Furthermore, the ARCSS-PP is openly available to be used by AO modelers to calibrate, assimilate, validate and compare community ecosystem and biogeochemical numerical models and, when combined with field work, will allow for improved understanding, detection and prediction of long-term biological patterns.},

	abstract = {The chemical transformations that govern storage, degradation, and loss of organic matter in northern peatlands are poorly characterized, despite the significance of these peat deposits as pivotal reservoirs in the global carbon cycle. One of the most challenging problems concerns the character of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in peat porewaters, particularly higher-molecular weight compounds that may function either as non-reactive sinks or reactive intermediates for organic byproducts of microbial decay. The complexity of these large molecules has defied attempts to characterize their molecular structure in bulk samples with a high degree of precision. We therefore determined the composition and reactivity of DOM from representative bog and fen sites in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (GLAP) in northern Minnesota, USA. We applied four complementary techniques: electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and excitation‚Äìemission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. We observed that the vast majority ({\textgreater}80\%) of molecular formulas that appear in the surface bog DOM are also present at 2.9m depth, indicating that much of DOM in the bog is resistant to microbial degradation. In contrast to bog samples, a considerable number of new compounds with low O/C and high H/C elemental ratios were observed in the 3m fen horizon relative to surface samples. These results indicate a more pronounced difference in the composition of surface and deep DOM in the fen. SUVA, determined at 254nm, indicated significantly lower aromaticity in deep fen samples relative to deep bog samples. This trend was verified by 1H NMR. Aromatic and carbohydrate components represented up to 70\% of deep bog DOM but comprised a much smaller proportion of deep fen DOM, which was dominated by functionalized and non-functionalized aliphatics. Molecular formula data determined by FT-ICR mass spectrometry were consistent with results from optical and NMR spectroscopy measurements and showed that compounds with low O/C and high H/C were generated with depth in the fen. Such compounds were absent in both surface fen and in surface and deep bog samples respectively, providing further evidence of qualitative and quantitative differences in the evolution of DOM in fens and bogs. These differences, attributed to either variations in source vegetation or environmental factors that render DOM more reactive in fen sites or less reactive in bog sites, have important implications for the response of peatlands to climate change, since climatic change leading to moister conditions may enhance the abundance of sedge-dominated fens and increase the pool of more labile soil carbon.},

SUVA, therefore, is shown to be a useful parameter for estimating the dissolved aromatic carbon content in aquatic systems. Experiments involving the reactivity of DOC with chlorine and tetra- methylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), however, show a wide range of reactivity for samples with similar SUVA values. These results indicate that, while SUVA measurements are good predictors of general chemical characteristics of DOC, they do not provide information about reactivity of DOC derived from different types of source materials. Sample pH, nitrate, and iron were found to influence SUVA measurements.},

	abstract = {Fresh water from summer ice melt and the total freshwater content of the Arctic Ocean water column above the thermocline are estimated from vertical profiles of temperature and salinity observed on the I/B Oden 1991 cruise. The seasonal ice melt ranges from 0.5 m to slightly above 1 m and is moderately uniform over the observation area. Regions of lower melting are seen over the Morris Jesup Plateau. The freshwater content is calculated relative to the salinity just above the thermocline north of the Barents Sea. The freshwater content increases toward the interior of the Arctic Ocean, showing that fresh water is advected from other regions into the observation area. Regions of different freshwater content are separated by fronts over the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge, over the Lomonosov Ridge, and in the western Eurasian Basin between waters derived from the Eurasian and Canadian Basins. Denser water, homogenized north of the Barents Sea, is recognized by a temperature minimum layer. The absence of the temperature minimum near the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge indicates that heat is transferred from the Atlantic Layer over a longer time than the shortest route would allow. This observation can be explained if the layer circulates together with the Atlantic Layer, i.e., toward the east, and returns above the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge and along the Amundsen Basin. North of the Laptev Sea, this water formed north of the Barents Sea becomes covered by low-salinity shelf water. The increased freshwater content limits the winter convection, so it no longer reaches the thermocline and an intermediate halocline is formed. The halocline in the Eurasian Basin consists of water originating from winter convection in the Arctic Ocean north of the Barents Sea, which then circulates around the basin. Such a formation mechanism also explains the observed distribution of low NO water. The strong density increase limits vertical exchange, and the vertical diffusion coefficient in the halocline is small (‚àº1 √ó 10‚àí6 m2 s‚àí1). The increased temperature of the halocline shows that the heat lost upward by the Atlantic Layer, mainly by double-diffusive convection, is trapped below the mixed layer.},

Water masses having distinctly different Œò‚ÄìS characteristics are organised throughout the central basins in extensive layers, consistent with occurrence of double-diffusive convection. In the Eurasian Basin, these structures can be explained by invoking formation along the narrow frontal region associated with the confluence of Fram Strait and Barents Sea waters north of the Kara Sea, and subsequent advection by the main circulation field. The presence of features in the interior of the basins requires a combination of processes that could include self-induced migration, through double-diffusive convection, as well as advection, across the central regions having weak horizontal gradients in temperature and salinity.},

	abstract = {The dense waters of the Iceland and Greenland sea gyres are not simply the product of a gradual transition between cold, relatively fresh polar waters on the west and warmer, saline Atlantic water on the east, but instead constitute a unique hydrographic region, bounded by the polar and arctic fronts, which we term the arctic domain. Although deep and bottom water is the best-known water mass formed in the arctic domain, the region also produces a spectrum of dense intermediate water types in winter. Our study concentrates upon water mass formation in the Iceland Sea, where the principal winter product is an intermediate water mass nearly as cold as the deep water, but slightly less saline and therefore always lying above the deep water. The intermediate water mass produced in greatest volume in the Greenland Sea is warmer and more saline, although of nearly the same density as that produced in the Iceland Sea. The principal difference between the seasonal transitions in the Greenland and Iceland seas is that the transition in the Greenland Sea involves slightly more saline water than does that in the Iceland Sea, due to a more pronounced contribution of cooled Atlantic water. Subsequent along-isopycnal mixing of the intermediate water masses produces water which needs only to undergo a final cooling stage to he transformed into new deep and bottom water.},

	abstract = {The mixing and spreading of the Storfjorden overflow were investigated with density and horizontal velocity profiles collected at closely spaced stations. The dense bottom water generated by strong winter cooling, enhanced ice formation and the consequent brine rejection drains into and fills the depression of the fjord and upon reaching a 120-m deep sill, descends like a gravity current following the bathymetry towards the shelf edge. The observations covered an approximate 37-km path of the plume starting from about 68km downstream of the sill. The plume is identified as two layers: a dense layer 1 with relatively uniform vertical structure underlying a thicker layer 2 with larger vertical density gradients. Layer 1, probably remnants from earlier overflows, almost maintains its temperature‚Äìsalinity characteristics and spreads to a width of about 6km over its path, comparable to spread resulting from Ekman veering. Layer 2, on the other hand, is a mixing layer and widens to about 16km. The overflow, in its core, is observed to have salinities greater than 34.9, temperatures close to the freezing point, and light transmissivity typically 5\% less than that of the ambient waters. The overall properties of the observed part of the plume suggest dynamical stability with weak entrainment. However local mixing is observed through profiles of the gradient Richardson number, the non-dimensional ratio of density gradient over velocity gradient, which show portions with supercritical values in the vicinity of the plume‚Äìambient water interface. The net volume transport associated with the overflow is estimated to be 0.06Sv (Sv‚â°106m3s‚àí1) out of a section closest to the sill and almost double that as it leaves the section furthest downstream. The weak entrainment is estimated to account for the doubling of the volume transport between the two sections. A simple model proposed by Killworth (J. Geophys. Res. 106 (2001) 22267), giving the path of the overflow from a constant rate of vertical descent along the slope, compares well with our observations.},

	abstract = {A recurrent polynya is known to form in Storfjorden in winter time with associated formation of brine-enriched shelf water (BSW). Hydrographic observations made in spring and autumn 1998 to 2002 are studied to reveal watermass compositions and transformations in Storfjorden and to document the seasonal formation, build-up and subsequent drainage of BSW in the fjord basin. A new compiled bathymetry model of Storfjorden recovers the approximately 120m deep and 40km wide sill at about 77¬∞N, and the total area and volume are 12,882km2 and 850km3, respectively. The cyclonic coastal current in Storfjorden has a typical geostrophic velocity of 0.1‚Äì0.2ms-1 and a total baroclinic transport of 0.04‚Äì0.11Sv. The core of the North Atlantic water (NAW) inflow is at 60‚Äì70m depth, and the amount varies interannually and seasonally. The total heat and freshwater content are in the range of 41‚Äì93√ó1017J and 80‚Äì156√ó108m3. Normally, Arctic water (ArW) is the source water of BSW, and in years with extremely high BSW salinity, also modified NAW, Polar Front water or East Spitsbergen water are possible candidates. The maximum observed BSW salinity varies interannually by more than 1. The BSW overflow is confined to the western side of the sill entrance, and its transport estimates give that the overflow is geostrophically (rotationally) and not hydraulically controlled. The overflow has a mean geostrophic velocity in the range of 0.1‚Äì0.2ms-1 with a corresponding mean geostrophic transport of 0.01‚Äì0.21Sv. A higher density difference between the BSW and the overlying water can result in stronger overflow in autumn than in winter. In addition to wind, freshwater supply and large-scale pressure gradients, the overflow seems to drive a compensating inflow with warmer ArW up to 1.7¬∞C above freezing temperature on the western side of the sill entrance, and the strength of the estuarine circulation. The overflow of dense water is determined by the production of dense water in the fjord, not by any restriction of the overflow at the sill.},

	abstract = {Arctic waters are often enriched with terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) characterized by having elevated visible wavelength fluorescence (commonly termed humic-like). Here, we have identified the sources of fluorescent DOM (FDOM) in a high Arctic fjord (Young Sound, NE Greenland) influenced by glacial meltwater. The biological transformation of FDOM was further investigated using plankton community size-fractionation experiments. The intensity of ultraviolet fluorescence (commonly termed amino acid-like) was highly variable and positively correlated to bacterial production and mesozooplankton grazing. The overall distribution of visible FDOM in the fjord was hydrographically driven by the high-signal intrusion of Arctic terrestrial DOM from shelf waters and dilution with glacial runoff in the surface waters. However, the high-intensity visible FDOM that accumulated in subsurface waters in summer was not solely linked to allochthonous sources. Our data indicate that microbial activity, in particular, protist bacterivory, to be a source. A decrease in visible FDOM in subsurface waters was concurrent with an increase in bacterial abundance, indicating an active bacterial uptake or modification of this DOM fraction. This was confirmed by net-loss of visible FDOM in experiments during summer when bacterial activity was high. The degradation of visible FDOM appeared to be associated with bacteria belonging to the order Alteromonadales mainly the genus Glaciecola and the SAR92 clade. The findings provide new insight into the character of Arctic terrestrial DOM and the biological production and degradation of both visible and UV wavelength organic matter in the coastal Arctic.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present data on hydrography, nutrients, phytoplankton biomass distribution and photosynthetic activity from a cruise in early August 2007, covering the waters between the island of Hopen on Spitsbergenbanken and of Storbanken in the Barents Sea. The Polar Front, which separates Atlantic and Arctic waters, was observed along the eastern slope of Spitsbergenbanken at 29.5¬∞E and the western slope of Storbanken around 33¬∞. A surface layer front associated with the meltwater appeared near 26.7¬∞E on Spitsbergenbanken, with strong horizontal temperature and salinity gradients, but relatively weak horizontal density gradients. Phytoplankton biomass was generally low with chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations lower than 2mgm‚àí3. No stimulatory front effect was found in this context. The highest concentrations were found as subsurface maximum over Spitsbergenbanken. Nutrients were also low, probably limiting phytoplankton growth. However, enhanced photosynthetic activity was seen near the pycnocline on Storbanken and Spitsbergenbanken, probably an effect of turbulent mixing caused by strong tidal currents, bringing phytoplankton cells in contact with more nutrient rich water, originating from below the pycnocline. Low-light acclimated phytoplankton cells were found at depth in stratified Atlantic Water. About 60\% of the nitrate winter reservoir for the upper 100m of the water column had been consumed during the growth season prior to the cruise. This corresponds to a new primary production of 48gCm‚àí2. At the time of the cruise, however, primary production was probably based on regenerated nutrients, conditions that seemed to favour dominance of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and ultraplankton ({\textless}5Œºm) flagellates.},

	abstract = {Marine microbes are critical players in the global carbon cycle, affecting both the reduction of inorganic carbon and the remineralization of reduced organic compounds back to carbon dioxide. Members of microbial consortia all depend on marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) and in turn, affect the molecules present in this heterogeneous pool. Our understanding of DOM produced by marine microbes is biased towards single species laboratory cultures or simplified field incubations, which exclude large phototrophs and protozoan grazers. Here we explore the interdependence of DOM composition and bacterial diversity in two mixed microbial consortia from coastal seawater: a whole water community and a {\textless}1.0-Œºm community dominated by heterotrophic bacteria. Each consortium was incubated with isotopically-labeled glucose for 9 days. Using stable-isotope probing techniques and electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, we show that the presence of organisms larger than 1.0-Œºm is the dominant factor affecting bacterial diversity and low-molecular-weight ({\textless}1000 Da) DOM composition over this experiment. In the {\textless}1.0-Œºm community, DOM composition was dominated by compounds with lipid and peptide character at all time points, confirmed by fragmentation spectra with peptide-containing neutral losses. In contrast, DOM composition in the whole water community was nearly identical to that in the initial coastal seawater. These differences in DOM composition persisted throughout the experiment despite shifts in bacterial diversity, underscoring an unappreciated role for larger microorganisms in constraining DOM composition in the marine environment.},

	abstract = {Dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in ecosystems are controlled by a suite of interacting physical, chemical, and biological factors. Growing recognition of the associations between microbial communities and metabolism and intrinsic DOM characteristics, highlight the potential importance of microbe-DOM relationships to modulate the role and fate of DOM, yet these relationships are difficult to isolate because they often operate across confounding environmental gradients. In a controlled laboratory incubation (44 days), we integrated DOM bulk and molecular characterization, bacterial abundances, microbial assemblage composition, nutrient concentrations, and cellular respiration to discern the structural dynamics of biological processing among DOM sources from different allochthonous litters (grass, deciduous leaves, and evergreen needles). We identified two periods, consistent among DOM sources, where processing dynamics differed. Further, bulk fluorescent analyses showed shifts from low to high excitation and emission wavelengths, indicating the biological production of more complex/degraded materials over time. Molecular level analyses revealed similar temporal patterns among DOM sources in the production and consumption of individual chemical components varying in reactivity and heteroatomic content. Despite these similarities, total carbon (C) removed and carbon dioxide (CO2) accumulation differed by {\textasciitilde} 20\% and 25\% among DOM sources. This range in C processing was apparently tied to key chemical properties of the DOM (e.g., initial DOM composition, N content, and labile nature) as well as differential reorganization of the microbial populations that decomposed the DOM. We conclude that the production, transformation, and consumption of C in aquatic ecosystems is strongly dependent on the source and character of DOM as well as the structure of the microbial communities present, both of which change as DOM is processed over time. It is crucial that stream C processing models represent this complexity accurately.},

	abstract = {The reason behind the millennial stability of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is subject of controversial discussion. It may be derived by either the occurrence of mainly stable chemical structures or concentrations of individual DOM molecules too low for efficient microbial growth. One of the major challenges in solving this enigma is that, to date, full structural elucidation of DOM remains impossible. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry can resolve the composition of DOM on a molecular formula level, but the molecular diversity of the isomers behind each formula is unknown. The objective of our study was to fill this gap of knowledge. Molecular fragmentation experiments were performed via Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) on single substances and molecular formulae isolated from deep-sea DOM. We estimated carboxyl (COOH) content with help of two novel measures, one derived from molecular formula information alone and one from fragment ion intensities. For the carboxyl content of single substances, they were poor predictors and fragment ion intensities were highly sensitive to structural properties. For natural DOM, on the contrary, both parameters were highly significantly correlated, despite obvious structural differences between the molecular formulae considered in this study. By using a model approach based on the central limit theorem, we were able to show that the observed fragment ion intensities of DOM may be explained by intrinsic averaging. These results are clear experimental evidence that many isomers exist per molecular formula. Model calculations showed that the observable molecular properties of DOM apparently emerged as averages of multiple isomers according to the central limit theorem. Structural differences between isomers that would reduce the accuracy of our measures for carboxyl content lost their effect due to averaging. Our model calculations based on the central limit theorem indicated that there are at least 100,000 different compounds in DOM each present in seawater at picomolar concentrations.},

	abstract = {We present a marine two-phase gas model in one dimension (M2PG1) resolving interaction between the free and dissolved gas phases and the gas propagation toward the atmosphere in aquatic environments. The motivation for the model development was to improve the understanding of benthic methane seepage impact on aquatic environments and its effect on atmospheric greenhouse gas composition. Rising, dissolution, and exsolution of a wide size-range of bubbles comprising several gas species are modeled simultaneously with the evolution of the aqueous gas concentrations. A model sensitivity analysis elucidates the relative importance of process parameterizations and environmental effects on the gas behavior. The parameterization of transfer velocity across bubble rims has the greatest inÔ¨Çuence on the resulting gas distribution, and bubble sizes are critical for predicting the fate of emitted bubble gas. High salinity increases the rise height of bubbles; whereas temperature does not signiÔ¨Åcantly alter it. Vertical mixing and aerobic oxidation play insigniÔ¨Åcant roles in environments where advection is important. The model, applied in an Arctic Ocean methane seepage location, showed good agreement with acoustically derived bubble rise heights and in situ sampled methane concentration proÔ¨Åles. Coupled with numerical ocean circulation and biogeochemical models, M2PG1 could predict the impact of benthic methane emissions on the marine environment and the atmosphere on long time scales and large spatial scales. Because of its Ô¨Çexibility, M2PG1 can be applied in a wide variety of environmental settings and future M2PG1 applications may include gas leakage from seaÔ¨Çoor installations and bubble injection by wave action.},

In the present study, hydrolyzable amino sugars were measured in a variety of marine organisms and particulate organic matter (POM) and in ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter (UDOM) from various ocean basins and depths. Glucosamine (GlcN) and galactosamine (GalN) were abundant and common to all samples. Concentrations of these two amino sugars were similar to their neutral sugar counterparts, glucose and galactose, and in surface water they accounted for up to 1.5\% of C and N in POM and 2.5\% of C and 7.1\% of N in UDOM. Chitin, a polymer of glucosamine, is produced by many marine organisms, but based on the low GlcN : GalN ratios (1.0‚Äì2.5) in POM and UDOM, it does not appear to be a primary source of glucosamine in these samples. Muramic acid, an amino sugar found only in the bacterial cell wall polymer peptidoglycan, was relatively abundant in POM, indicating that bacterial detritus is a principal component of submicron particles in seawater. Muramic acid was measured in all UDOM samples, but its concentrations were low ({\textless}1 nmol L‚àí1), indicating that intact fragments of peptidoglycan were a relatively minor component of UDOM. The abundance of GlcN and GalN and their similar concentrations in POM and UDOM provide novel information suggesting a major prokaryotic source.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) contains a complex array of chemical components that are intimately linked to many environmental processes, including the global carbon cycle, and the fate and transport of chemical pollutants. Despite its importance, fundamental aspects, such as the structural components in DOM remain elusive, due in part to the molecular complexity of the material. Here, we utilize multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to demonstrate the major structural components in Lake Ontario DOM. These include carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM), heteropolysaccharides, and aromatic compounds, which are consistent with components recently identified in marine dissolved organic matter (1). In addition, long-range proton-carbon correlations are obtained for DOM, which support the existence of material derived from linear terpenoids (MDLT). It is tentatively suggested that the bulk of freshwater dissolved organic matter is aliphatic in nature, with CRAM derived from cyclic terpenoids, and MDLT derived from linear terpenoids. This is in agreement with previous reports which indicate terpenoids as major precursors of DOM (2). At this time it is not clear in Lake Ontario whether these precursors are of terrestrial or aquatic origin or whether transformations proceed via biological and/or photochemical processes.},

	abstract = {Soils, sediments, freshwaters, and marine waters contain natural organic matter (NOM), an exceedingly complex mixture of organic compounds that collectively exhibit a nearly continuous range of properties (size-reactivity continuum). NOM is composed mainly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with minor contributions from heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. Suwannee River fulvic acid (SuwFA) is a fraction of NOM that is relatively depleted in heteroatoms. Ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron (FTICR) mass spectra of SuwFA reveal several thousand molecular formulas, corresponding in turn to several hundred thousand distinct chemical environments of carbon even without accountancy of isomers. The mass difference Œîm among adjoining C,H,O-molecules between and within clusters of nominal mass is inversely related to molecular dissimilarity: any decrease of Œîm imposes an ever growing mandatory difference in molecular composition. Molecular formulas that are expected for likely biochemical precursor molecules are notably absent from these spectra, indicating that SuwFA is the product of diagenetic reactions that have altered the major components of biomass beyond the point of recognition. The degree of complexity of SuwFA can be brought into sharp focus through comparison with the theoretical limits of chemical complexity, as constrained and quantized by the fundamentals of chemical binding. The theoretical C,H,O-compositional space denotes the isomer-filtered complement of the entire, very vast space of molecular structures composed solely of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The molecular formulas within SuwFA occupy a sizable proportion of the theoretical C,H,O-compositional space. A 100 percent coverage of the theoretically feasible C,H,O-compositional space by SuwFA molecules is attained throughout a sizable range of mass and H/C and O/C elemental ratios. The substantial differences between (and complementarity of) the SuwFA molecular formulas that are observed using six different modes of ionization (APCI, APPI, and ESI in positive and negative modus) imply considerable selectivity of the ionization process and suggest that the observed mass spectra represent simplified projections of still more complex mixtures.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) contained in lake sediments is a carbon source for many microbial degradation processes, including aerobic and anaerobic mineralization. During anaerobic degradation, DOM is partially consumed and transformed into new molecules while the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are produced. In this study, we used ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to trace differences in the composition of solid-phase extractable (PPL resin) pore water DOM (SPE-DOM) isolated from surface sediments of three boreal lakes before and after 40 days of anoxic incubation, with concomitant determination of CH4 and CO2 evolution. CH4 and CO2 production detected by gas chromatography varied considerably among replicates and accounted for fractions of ‚àº2‚Äì4¬†√ó¬†10‚àí4 of sedimentary organic carbon for CO2 and ‚àº0.8‚Äì2.4¬†√ó¬†10‚àí5 for CH4. In contrast, the relative changes of key bulk parameters during incubation, such as relative proportions of molecular series, elemental ratios, average mass and unsaturation, were regularly in the percent range (1‚Äì3\% for compounds decreasing and 4‚Äì10\% for compounds increasing), i.e. several orders of magnitude higher than mineralization alone. Computation of the average carbon oxidation state in CHO molecules of lake pore water DOM revealed rather non-selective large scale transformations of organic matter during incubation, with depletion of highly oxidized and highly reduced CHO molecules, and formation of rather non-labile fulvic acid type molecules. In general, proportions of CHO compounds slightly decreased. Nearly saturated CHO and CHOS lipid-like substances declined during incubation: these rather commonplace molecules were less specific indicators of lake sediment alteration than the particular compounds, such as certain oxygenated aromatics and carboxyl-rich alicyclic acids (CRAM) found more abundant after incubation. There was a remarkable general increase in many CHNO compounds during incubation across all lakes. Differences in DOM transformation between lakes corresponded with lake size and water residence time. While in the small lake Svarttj√§rn, CRAM increased during incubation, lignin-and tannin-like compounds were enriched in the large lake Bisen, suggesting selective preservation of these rather non-labile aromatic compounds rather than recent synthesis. SPE-DOM after incubation may represent freshly synthesized compounds, leftover bulk DOM which is primarily composed of intrinsically refractory molecules and/or microbial metabolites which were not consumed in our experiments. In spite of a low fraction of the total DOM being mineralized to CO2 and CH4, the more pronounced change in molecular DOM composition during the incubation indicates that diagenetic modification of organic matter can be substantial compared to complete mineralization.},

	abstract = {With the advent of ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (MS), recent studies have begun to resolve molecular relationships between terrestrial and aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in rivers, estuaries, mangrove swamps and their receiving oceans and lakes. Here, we extend ultrahigh resolution MS techniques to Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake in the world by area. Solid-phase extracted samples from the western arm of the lake and its watershed, including swamp, creek, river, lake‚Äìriver confluence and offshore lake sites were compared using electrospray ionization (ESI), Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (FT-ICR-MS). Results were analyzed using cluster analysis and van Krevelen diagrams. Chemical similarity appears related to hydrological proximity, terrestrial impact and flow conditions. For example, higher and lower flow samples from the same stream differ from one another. Toivola Swamp, Lake Superior and the south shore river have diverse arrays of unique molecular formulae relative to the north shore river and stream sampled in the data set. The lake‚Äôs unique elemental formulae, relative to its watershed samples, are primarily in the lignin-like and reduced hydrocarbon regions of van Krevelen diagrams. The ESI-amenable lake DOM also has a higher proportion of formulae containing nitrogen or sulfur relative to the other samples. The degree of overlap among formulae within the data set is consistent with previous ESI FT-ICR-MS characterization of terrestrial, estuarine and marine OM. There appears to be a conserved portion of formulae across natural OM samples, perhaps because these compounds are intrinsically refractory or because they are commonly generated as products of natural reworking processes.},

	abstract = {Mass spectrometry has recently played a key role in the understanding of natural organic matter (NOM) by providing molecular-level details about its composition. NOM, a complex assemblage of organic molecules present in natural waters and soils/sediments, has the ability to bind and transport anthropogenic materials. An improved understanding of its composition is crucial in order to understand how pollutants interact with NOM and how NOM cycles through global carbon cycles. In the past, low-resolution ({\textgreater}3000) mass analyzers have offered some insights into the structure of NOM, but emerging ultrahigh resolution ({\textgreater}200 000) techniques such as electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) have significantly advanced our knowledge of NOM chemistry. Here, a review of the recent literature on the advancements of NOM characterization and the applications of mass spectrometry to this central task is presented. Various methods for the analysis and display of the extremely complex mass spectra, such as the van Krevelen diagram and Kendrick mass defect analysis, are discussed. We also review tandem mass spectrometry techniques employed to gain structural information about NOM components. Finally, we show how ESI-FT-ICR-MS has been applied to examine specific issues that are important to the NOM scientific community, such as NOM reactivity, transport and fate, degradation, and existence of components, which are indicators of NOM origin. In general, ultrahigh resolution provided by FT-ICR-MS is essential for the complete separation of the thousands of peaks present in the complex NOM mixture and will clearly lead to additional future advancements in the areas of aquatic, soil, and analytical chemistry.

	abstract = {Decomposing natural organic matter found in terrestrial and marine environments consists of a heterogenous mixture of particles and molecules with variable physical and chemical properties. The amount of organic matter present in these systems is controlled by the relative rates of accumulation and loss. Accumulation is controlled principally by net primary productivity whilst losses are mainly a function of the biological stability of the biomolecules present. Processes of lateral transfer can also be significant to both rates of accumulation and loss in localized zones. In this paper, the processes and properties responsible for defining the biological stability of organic matter in terrestrial and marine ecosystems are examined. A conceptual model illustrating the implications that mechanisms of biological stabilisation can have on the molecular composition of natural organic matter in these ecosystems is presented. Molecular composition has typically been determined using a variety of selective degradative methodologies either individually or in combination. These methodologies often only identify 20‚Äì80\% of the organic matter present with the extent of identification decreasing as the degree of biological processing increases. Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be used for routine assessment of the chemistry of organic materials; however, no direct measure of the molecular composition can be obtained. Previous work that examined the ability of using solid-state 13C NMR data in a simple mixing model to predict molecular composition is extended in this study. The extended mixing model is then used to characterise changes in the molecular composition of decomposing organic material in soil and marine systems. The extended mixing model accounted for the distribution of 13C NMR signal intensity of all samples examined and allowed the biomolecular and elemental composition to be estimated. Decomposition induced changes in molecular composition were very different in the terrestrial and marine systems examined, but the direction of change suggested a convergence towards the formation of similar decomposition products.},

The unrecycled fraction of this organic matter can become buried in ocean sediments, thus sequestering carbon and so influencing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations3. The processes controlling the extensive biodegradation of sinking particles remain unclear, partly because of the difficulty in resolving the composition of the residual organic matter at depth with existing chromatographic techniques4. Here, using solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy5, we characterize the chemical structure of organic carbon in both surface plankton and sinking particulate matter from the Pacific Ocean4 and the Arabian Sea6. We found that minimal changes occur in bulk organic composition, despite extensive ({\textgreater}98\%) biodegradation, and that amino-acid-like material predominates throughout the water column in both regions. The compositional similarity between phytoplankton biomass and the small remnant of organic matter reaching the ocean interior indicates that the formation of unusual biochemicals, either by chemical recombination7 or microbial biosynthesis8, is not the main process controlling the preservation of particulate organic carbon within the water column at these two sites. We suggest instead that organic matter might be protected from degradation by the inorganic matrix of sinking particles.},

Sampling was performed at depths of 5 m (Angola Current; near-surface photic zone), 48 m (Angola Current; fluorescence maximum), 200 m (still above Antarctic Intermediate Water, AAIW; upper mesopelagic zone) and 5446 m (North Atlantic Deep Water, NADW; abyssopelagic, {\textasciitilde}30 m above seafloor) and produced SPE-DOM with near 40\% carbon yield and beneficial nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation properties, a crucial prerequisite for the acquisition of NMR spectra with excellent resolution. $^{\textrm{1}}$H and $^{\textrm{13}}$C NMR spectra of all four marine SPE-DOM showed smooth bulk envelopes, reflecting intrinsic averaging from massive signal overlap, with a few percent of visibly resolved signatures and variable abundances for all major chemical environments. The abundance of singly oxygenated aliphatics and acetate derivatives in $^{\textrm{1}}$H NMR spectra declined from surface to deep marine SPE-DOM, whereas C-based aliphatics and carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) increased in abundance. Surface SPE-DOM contained fewer methyl esters than all other samples, likely a consequence of direct exposure to sunlight. Integration of $^{\textrm{13}}$C NMR spectra revealed continual increase of carboxylic acids and ketones from surface to depth, reflecting a progressive oxygenation, with concomitant decline of carbohydrate-related substructures. Aliphatic branching increased with depth, whereas the fraction of oxygenated aliphatics declined for methine, methylene and methyl carbon. Lipids in the oldest SPE-DOM at 5446 m showed a larger share of ethyl groups and methylene carbon than observed in the other samples. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Two-dimensional NMR spectra showed exceptional resolution and depicted resolved molecular signatures in excess of a certain minimum abundance. Classical methyl groups terminating aliphatic chains represented {\textasciitilde}15\% of total methyl in all samples investigated.

Methyl ethers were abundant in surface marine SPE-DOM, and the chemical diversity of carbohydrates was larger than that of freshwater and soil DOM. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} In all samples, we identified sp$^{\textrm{2}}$-hybridized carbon chemical environments with discrimination of isolated and conjugated olefins and \textit{Œ±},\textit{\&beta;}-unsaturated double bonds. Olefinic proton and carbon atoms were more abundant than aromatic ones; olefinic unsaturation in marine SPE-DOM will be more directly traceable to ultimate biogenic precursors than aromatic unsaturation. The abundance of furan, pyrrol and thiophene derivatives was marginal, whereas benzene derivatives, phenols and six-membered nitrogen heterocycles were prominent; a yet unassigned set of six-membered N-heterocycles with likely more than one single nitrogen occurred in all samples. Various key polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon substructures suggested the presence of thermogenic organic matter at all water depths. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Progressive NMR cross-peak attenuation from surface to deep marine SPE-DOM was particularly strong in COSY NMR spectra and indicated a continual disappearance of biosignatures as well as entropy gain from an ever increased molecular diversity. Nevertheless, a specific near-seafloor SPE-DOM signature of unsaturated molecules recognized in both NMR and Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FTICR/MS) possibly originated from sediment leaching. The conformity of key NMR and FTICR/MS signatures suggested the presence of a large set of identical molecules throughout the entire ocean column even though the investigated water masses belonged to different oceanic regimes and currents. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} FTICR/MS showed abundant CHO, CHNO, CHOS and CHNOS molecular series with slightly increasing numbers of mass peaks and average mass from surface to bottom SPE-DOM.

While certain rather aliphatic CHOS and CHNOS ions were observed solely in the surface, deep marine SPE-DOM was enriched in unique unsaturated and rather oxygenated CHO and CHNO molecular series.

As DOM is an amalgam of heterogeneous compounds comprising gradients of microbial and physicochemical reactivity, the factors influencing DOM processing at the molecular level and the resulting patterns in DOM composition are not well understood. Here we show, using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to unambiguously identify 4,032 molecular formulae in 120 lakes across Sweden, that the molecular composition of DOM is shaped by precipitation, water residence time and temperature. Terrestrially derived DOM is selectively lost as residence time increases, with warmer temperatures enhancing the production of nitrogen-containing compounds. Using biodiversity concepts, we show that the molecular diversity of DOM, or chemodiversity, increases with DOM and nutrient concentrations. The observed molecular-level patterns indicate that terrestrially derived DOM will become more prevalent in lakes as climate gets wetter.},

Here we examine dissolved organic matter from 109 Swedish lakes using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopy to investigate the constraints on its persistence in the environment. We find that degradation processes preferentially remove oxidized, aromatic compounds, whereas reduced, aliphatic and N-containing compounds are either resistant to degradation or tightly cycled and thus persist in aquatic systems. The patterns we observe for individual molecules are consistent with our measurements of emergent bulk characteristics of organic matter at wide geographic and temporal scales, as reflected by optical properties. We conclude that intrinsic molecular properties are an important control of overall organic matter reactivity.},

	abstract = {Electrospray ionization (ESI) combined with ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry on a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer has been shown to be a very powerful tool for the analysis of fulvic and humic acids and of natural organic matter (NOM) at the molecular level. With this technique thousands of ions can be separated from each other and their m/z ratio determined with sufficient accuracy to allow molecular formula calculation. Organic biogeochemistry, water chemistry, and atmospheric chemistry greatly benefit from this technique. Methodical aspects concerning the application of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) to NOM isolated from surface water, groundwater, marine waters, and soils as well as from secondary organic aerosol in the atmospheric are reviewed. Enrichment of NOM and its chromatographic separation as well as possible influences of the ionization process on the appearance of the mass spectra are discussed. These steps of the analytical process require more systematic investigations. A basic drawback, however, is the lack of well defined single reference compounds of NOM or fulvic acids. Approaches of molecular formula calculation from the mass spectrometric data are reviewed and available graphical presentation methods are summarized. Finally, unsolved issues that limit the quality of data generated by FTICR-MS analysis of NOM are elaborated. It is concluded that further development in NOM enrichment and chromatographic separation is required and that tools for data analysis, data comparison and data visualization ought to be improved to make full use of FTICR-MS in NOM analysis.},

This work uses ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to determine the molecular composition of three organic matter fractions of soils and aqueous extracts of crop biomass. Comparison of the van Krevelen plots allowed tracking the changes in organic matter with increasing humification. Aqueous plant biomass extracts contain a diverse mixture of lipids, proteins, and lignins. Soil aqueous extracts were marked by increases in lignin and carbohydrate components and decrease in the protein component as compared to the plant extract. Refractory humic acid fractions were marked by decrease in the lignin component and increases in the lipid and condensed aromatic components. The multivariate indicator species analysis was used to identify marker components of the four organic matter types investigated. The plant extract group had 772 marker components compared to 237 for soil aqueous extract, 92 for mobile humic acid, and 418 for calcium humic acid. This study demonstrates that ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and multivariate methods can be used to identify marker components to gain a molecular-scale description and understanding of C dynamics.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new and simple method to find indicator species and species assemblages characterizing groups of sites. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we combine a species relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the various groups of sites. This index is maximum when all individuals of a species are found in a single group of sites and when the species occurs in all sites of that group; it is a symmetric indicator. The statistical significance of the species indicator values is evaluated using a randomization procedure. Contrary to Twinspan, our indicator index for a given species is independent of the other species relative abundances, and there is no need to use pseudospecies. The new method identifies indicator species for typologies of species relev√©s obtained by any hierarchical or nonhierarchical classification procedure; its use is independent of the classification method. Because indicator species give ecological meaning to groups of sites, this method provides criteria to compare typologies, to identify where to stop dividing clusters into subsets, and to point out the main levels in a hierarchical classification of sites. Species can be grouped on the basis of their indicator values for each clustering level, the heterogeneous nature of species assemblages observed in any one site being well preserved. Such assemblages are usually a mixture of eurytopic (higher level) and stenotopic species (characteristic of lower level clusters). The species assemblage approach demonstrates the importance of the ‚Äúsampled patch size,‚Äù i.e., the diversity of sampled ecological combinations, when we compare the frequencies of core and satellite species. A new way to present species‚Äìsite tables, accounting for the hierarchical relationships among species, is proposed. A large data set of carabid beetle distributions in open habitats of Belgium is used as a case study to illustrate the new method.},

Within each treatment, a 0.4-ha permanent plot was established and subdivided into 0.04-ha square subplots. Harvests have been implemented every ten years with the most recent harvest occurring during the winter of 2008 - 2009. We quantified ground layer vegetation response before and after the most recent harvest. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination showed a very distinct separation between the most intensive management treatment (13-cm diameter-limit treatment) and the uncut control. Compositionally, the diameter-limit treatments moved with greater directionality and magnitude towards the 13-cm diameter-limit treatment following harvest, while compositional change in the residual basal area treatments was less pronounced and lacked strong directionality. Herbaceous species percent cover generally decreased with increasing residual overstory basal area across treatments. Weedy and early successional species were most abundant under lower residual basal area and diameter-limit treatments. Results based on 50 years of continuous management suggest that diameter-limit harvests likely have a greater impact on the herbaceous community than single-tree selection or no management.},

Besides characterizing the ecological preference of the species, the strength of the association usually presents a lot of interest for conservation biology, landscape mapping and management, and natural reserve design, among other applications. The indices most frequently employed to assess these relationships are the phi coefficient of association and the indicator value index (IndVal). We compare these two approaches by putting them into a broader framework of related measures, which includes several new indices. We present permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of species‚Äìsite group associations and bootstrap methods for obtaining confidence intervals. Correlation measures, such as the phi coefficient, are more context-dependent than indicator values but allow focusing on the preference of the species. In contrast, the two components of an indicator value index directly assess the value of the species as a bioindicator because they can be interpreted as its positive predictive value and sensitivity. Ecologists should select the most appropriate index of association strength according to their objective and then compute confidence intervals to determine the precision of the estimate.},

Labile molecules with turnover times of hours are metabolized within the stream reach where they originated; semi-labile molecules with turnover times of days travel out of the reach and are transported downstream before being metabolized; and a more recalcitrant class with a longer but undetermined turnover time flows through the river network without being metabolized. Between 26\% and 31\% of the DOC was biodegradable, with 8.6\% labile and the balance semi-labile. Humic-like FDOM was a proxy for more recalcitrant DOM, exhibiting a ¬± 2\% change as a function of increased bioreactor residence time. Humic-like FDOM represents only the more recalcitrant and perhaps the more hydrophobic constituents and not the ecologically important semi-labile humic substances within the BDOC pool. Tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like FDOM constituents included not only labile DOM, but also semi-labile, and more recalcitrant moieties. For example, 13\% of the tryptophan-like FDOM was labile, 14\% was semi-labile, and 73\% was more recalcitrant, while tyrosine-like FDOM was 100\% biodegraded and the majority (44‚Äì69\%) was classified as labile. Collectively our results challenge some previous assessments of FDOM lability classifications and highlight the need to connect fluorescence characteristics of DOM to residence times of different carbon pools that spiral through a river network.},

	abstract = {[ANOSIM, PERMANOVA, and the Mantel test are all resemblance-based permutation methods widely used in ecology. Here, we report the results of the first simulation study, to our knowledge, specifically designed to examine the effects of heterogeneity of multivariate dispersions on the rejection rates of these tests and on a classical MANOVA test (Pillai's trace). Increasing differences in dispersion among groups were simulated under scenarios of changing sample sizes, correlation structures, error distributions, numbers of variables, and numbers of groups for balanced and unbalanced one-way designs. The power of these tests to detect environmental impacts or natural large-scale biogeographic gradients was also compared empirically under simulations based on parameters derived from real ecological data sets. Overall, ANOSIM and the Mantel test were very sensitive to heterogeneity in dispersions, with ANOSIM generally being more sensitive than the Mantel test. In contrast, PERMANOVA and Pillai's trace were largely unaffected by heterogeneity for balanced designs. PERMANOVA was also unaffected by differences in correlation structure, unlike Pillai's trace. For unbalanced designs, however, all of the tests were (1) too liberal when the smaller group had greater dispersion and (2) overly conservative when the larger group had greater dispersion, especially ANOSIM and the Mantel test. For simulations based on real ecological data sets, PERMANOVA was generally, but not always, more powerful than the others to detect changes in community structure, and the Mantel test was usually more powerful than ANOSIM. Both the error distributions and the resemblance measure affected results concerning power. Differences in the underlying construction of thest test statistics result in important differences in the nature of the null hypothesis they are testing, their sensitivity to heterogeneity, and their power to detect important changes in ecological communities. For balanced designs, PERMANOVA and PERMDISP can be used to rigorously identify location vs. dispersion effects, respectively, in the space of the chosen resemblance measure. ANOSIM and the Mantel test can be used as more "omnibus" tests, being sensitive to differences in location, dispersion or correlation structure among groups. Unfortunately, none of the tests (PERMANOVA, Mantel, or ANOSIM) behaved reliably for unbalanced designs in the face of heterogeneity.]},

	abstract = {Abstract. Statistical measures of fidelity, i.e. the concentration of species occurrences in vegetation units, are reviewed and compared. The focus is on measures suitable for categorical data which are based on observed species frequencies within a vegetation unit compared with the frequencies expected under random distribution. Particular attention is paid to Bruelheide's u value. It is shown that its original form, based on binomial distribution, is an asymmetric measure of fidelity of a species to a vegetation unit which tends to assign comparatively high fidelity values to rare species. Here, a hypergeometric form of u is introduced which is a symmetric measure of the joint fidelity of species to a vegetation unit and vice versa. It is also shown that another form of the binomial u value may be defined which measures the asymmetric fidelity of a vegetation unit to a species. These u values are compared with phi coefficient, chi-square, G statistic and Fisher's exact test. Contrary to the other measures, phi coefficient is independent of the number of relev√©s in the data set, and like the hypergeometric form of u and the chi-square it is little affected by the relative size of the vegetation unit. It is therefore particularly useful when comparing species fidelity values among differently sized data sets and vegetation units. However, unlike the other measures it does not measure any statistical significance and may produce unreliable results for small vegetation units and small data sets. The above measures, all based on the comparison of observed/expected frequencies, are compared with the categorical form of the Dufr√™ne-Legendre Indicator Value Index, an index strongly underweighting the fidelity of rare species. These fidelity measures are applied to a data set of 15 989 relev√©s of Czech herbaceous vegetation. In a small subset of this data set which simulates a phytosociological table, we demonstrate that traditional table analysis fails to determine diagnostic species of general validity in different habitats and large areas. On the other hand, we show that fidelity calculations used in conjunction with large data sets can replace expert knowledge in the determination of generally valid diagnostic species. Averaging positive fidelity values for all species within a vegetation unit is a useful approach to measure quality of delimination of the vegetation unit. We propose a new way of ordering species in synoptic species-by-relev√© tables, using fidelity calculations.},

	abstract = {Cold seeps can support unique faunal communities via chemosynthetic interactions fueled by seabed emissions of hydrocarbons. Additionally, cold seeps can enhance habitat complexity at the deep seafloor through the accretion of methane derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC). We examined infaunal and megafaunal community structure at high-Arctic cold seeps through analyses of benthic samples and seafloor photographs from pockmarks exhibiting highly elevated methane concentrations in sediments and the water column at Vestnesa Ridge (VR), Svalbard (79¬∞ N). Infaunal biomass and abundance were five times higher, species richness was 2.5 times higher and diversity was 1.5 times higher at methane-rich Vestnesa compared to a nearby control region. Seabed photos reveal different faunal associations inside, at the edge, and outside Vestnesa pockmarks. Brittle stars were the most common megafauna occurring on the soft bottom plains outside pockmarks. Microbial mats, chemosymbiotic siboglinid worms, and carbonate outcrops were prominent features inside the pockmarks, and high trophic-level predators aggregated around these features. Our faunal data, visual observations, and measurements of sediment characteristics indicate that methane is a key environmental driver of the biological system at VR. We suggest that chemoautotrophic production enhances infaunal diversity, abundance, and biomass at the seep while MDAC create a heterogeneous deep-sea habitat leading to aggregation of heterotrophic, conventional megafauna. Through this combination of rich infaunal and megafaunal associations, the cold seeps of VR are benthic oases compared to the surrounding high-Arctic deep sea.},

To date, very few studies have examined the spatial heterogeneity of DOM in paddy soils. Thus, very little is known about the DOM molecular profiles and the key environmental factors that underpin DOM molecular chemodiversity in paddy soils. Here, Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry was applied to unambiguously resolve 11‚ÄØ361 molecular formulas in 16 paddy soils; thereby elucidating the molecular characteristics of paddy soil DOM. Soil pH, iron complexing index (Fep/FeR) and C/N ratio were established to be key factors controlling DOM profiles. Polycyclic aromatics (derived from combustion) and polyphenols (derived from plants) increased with increasing pH, while polyphenols molecules, pyrogenic aromatics, and carboxylic compounds decreased with increasing iron complexing index. Patterns in molecular profiles indicated DOM in paddy soils to become more recalcitrant at higher soil C/N ratio and higher pH. Furthermore, plant-derived polyphenols and pyrogenic DOM were retained favorably by iron and the chemodiversity of DOM in paddy soil increased with increasing soil C/N ratios. This study provides critical information about DOM characteristics at a molecular level and will inform better global management of soil carbon in paddy soil ecosystems.},

We compare two approaches: (1) using averages of elemental ratios and double bond equivalents calculated from the formulas, and (2) employing individual formulas and either their presence/absence or relative magnitude in each sample. With approach 2, PCA deciphers which of the thousands of formulas are significant to particular samples, and then a van Krevelen diagram highlights what types of compounds are molecular signatures to the samples. Our dual approach, especially approach 2, allows for complex data sets to be more easily interpreted, aiding in the characterization of DOM from various sources. By applying this methodology, clear trends can be delineated, trends that are not apparent from currently employed methods. Terrestrial DOM contains various lignin-derived compounds, tannins, and condensed aromatics. Marine DOM contains aliphatic compounds with heteroatom functionalities, as well as lignin-like molecules.},

Mitochondrial COI sequence analysis, in combination with detailed morphological investigations through both light and electron microscopy was used for identifying frenulate hosts, and comparing them to Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis and Oligobrachia webbi, two morphologically similar species known from the Norwegian Sea. Specimens from sites previously assumed to host O. haakonmosbiensis were included in our molecular analysis, which allowed us to provide new insight on the debate regarding species identity of these Oligobrachia worms. Our results indicate that high Arctic seeps are inhabited by a species that though closely related to Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis, is nonetheless distinct. We refer to this group as the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade, based on the colloquial names of the sites they are currently known to inhabit. Since members of the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade cannot be distinguished from O. haakonmosbiensis or O. webbi based on morphology, we suggest that a complex of cryptic Oligobrachia species inhabit seeps in the Norwegian Sea and the Arctic. The symbionts of the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade were also found to be closely related to O. haakonmosbiensis symbionts, but genetically distinct. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and transmission electron micrographs revealed extremely dense populations of bacteria within the trophosome of members of the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade, which is unusual for frenulates. Bacterial genes for sulfur oxidation were detected and small rod shaped bacteria (round in cross section), typical of siboglinid-associated sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, were seen on electron micrographs of trophosome bacteriocytes, suggesting that sulfide constitutes the main energy source. We hypothesize that specific, local geochemical conditions, in particular, high sulfide fluxes and concentrations could account for the unusually high symbiont densities in members of the Oligrobrachia sp.

However, some analytical measurements require sample pre-treatment, while others are carried out on bulk water samples, and it remains unclear if the resulting data sets can be compared. Here, we investigated the impact of solid-phase extraction with PPL resins on DOM optical properties. In samples from contrasting Arctic fjords, extraction efficiencies based on optical properties varied spectrally with averages between 31‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ13\% at 411‚ÄØnm and 40‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ12\% at 363‚ÄØnm for chromophoric DOM. Similarly, the extraction efficiency for specific fluorescence components varied between 37‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ16\% and 58‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ18\%. Solid-phase extraction also decreased S275‚Äì295, fluorescence index, and the freshness index, but increased S350‚Äì400, and apparent fluorescence quantum yields, indicating that the extraction process was qualitatively selective. Six fluorescence components identified independently in bulk water samples and extracted DOM using parallel factor analysis exhibited different behaviours. Three had identical spectral properties before and after extraction, although their extraction efficiencies varied with water mass characteristics and DOM composition, whereas three other components appeared to change after extraction. With the exception of one fluorescence component, the dynamics of optical properties in bulk water samples were not accurately reflected by DOM extracts. These results indicate that solid-phase extraction imparts a qualitative selectivity that leads to the homogenization of DOM extracts relative to their original samples. Efforts to integrate chemical information from different analytical methods should prioritize comparisons of measurements obtained on the same samples.},

The results reveal that at least five different fluorescent DOM fractions present (in significant amounts) in the catchment and that the relative composition is dependent on the source (e.g. agricultural runoff, forest soil, aquatic production). Four different allochthonous fluorescent groups and one autochthonous fluorescent group were identified. The ability to trace the different fractions of the DOM pool using this relatively cheap and fast technique represents a significant advance within the fields of aquatic ecology and chemistry, and will prove to be useful for catchment management.},

However, interpreting the {\textgreater}10,000 wavelength-dependent fluorescence intensity data points represented in EEMs has posed a significant challenge. Fluorescence regional integration, a quantitative technique that integrates the volume beneath an EEM, was developed to analyze EEMs. EEMs were delineated into five excitation‚àíemission regions based on fluorescence of model compounds, DOM fractions, and marine waters or freshwaters. Volumetric integration under the EEM within each region, normalized to the projected excitation‚àíemission area within that region and dissolved organic carbon concentration, resulted in a normalized region-specific EEM volume (Œ¶i,n). Solid-state carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, ultraviolet‚àívisible absorption spectra, and EEMs were obtained for standard Suwannee River fulvic acid and 15 hydrophobic or hydrophilic acid, neutral, and base DOM fractions plus nonfractionated DOM from wastewater effluents and rivers in the southwestern United States. DOM fractions fluoresced in one or more EEM regions. The highest cumulative EEM volume (Œ¶T,n = Œ£Œ¶i,n) was observed for hydrophobic neutral DOM fractions, followed by lower Œ¶T,n values for hydrophobic acid, base, and hydrophilic acid DOM fractions, respectively. An extracted wastewater biomass DOM sample contained aromatic protein- and humic-like material and was characteristic of bacterial-soluble microbial products. Aromatic carbon and the presence of specific aromatic compounds (as indicated by solid-state 13C NMR and FTIR data) resulted in EEMs that aided in differentiating wastewater effluent DOM from drinking water DOM.},

Classical upwelling patterns were observed near the coast, with strong fronts characterized by cold water, high chlorophyll a, and high nutrients. CDOM concentration showed a negative correlation with temperature in the surface waters throughout the study region, reflecting upwelling as the major source of CDOM to surface waters. Three water mass types were identified and found to have distinctive excitation‚Äìemission matrix (EEM) fingerprints. Persian Gulf Water had two fluorescence maxima due to UV and visible humic substance fluorescence. Maximum CDOM concentrations were found in the core of this water mass. Upwelling water had five or six fluorescence peaks, due to new and old CDOM. Elevated CDOM concentrations at the depth of the chlorophyll a maximum indicated production of new CDOM associated with the phytoplankton bloom. Oligotrophic water had extremely low CDOM concentrations, and only UV-absorbing and fluorescing compounds were found. This is consistent with CDOM which has been subjected to extensive exposure to solar irradiation at the sea surface. A new fluorophore with an Ex/Em maximum at 280/340nm is described from highly productive waters. Two new EEM fingerprints are presented, one for oligotrophic blue waters showing photoresistant DOM, and one for upwelling water that may be of biological origin.},

In this study, Arctic sea ice DOM was characterized for its optical (fluorescence) properties as well as the molecular sizes and composition via size exclusion chromatography and Fourier transformation ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Ice cores were collected along with the underlying seawater samples in Cambridge Bay, an Arctic area experiencing seasonal ice formation. The ice core samples revealed a marked enrichment of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compared to the seawater counterparts (up to 6.2 times greater). The accumulation can be attributed to in situ production by the autotrophic and heterotrophic communities. Fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEMs) elaborated with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) evidenced the prevalence of protein-like substances in the ice cores, which likely results from in situ production followed by accumulation in the ice. Size exclusion chromatography further revealed the in situ production of all DOM size fractions, with the exception of the humic substance fraction. The majority of DOM in both the ice and seawater consists of low molecular weight compounds ({\textless}350‚ÄØDa) probably derived by the microbial degradation/transformation of freshly produced DOM. Molecular characterization also supported the in situ production of DOM and highlighted the marked difference in molecular composition between sea ice and seawater. This study provides new insights into the possible role of sea ice DOM in the Arctic carbon cycle under climate change.},

In this study, a unique dataset of fluorescence excitation emission matrixes (EEMs) (n¬†=¬†867) was collected from all treatment stages of five drinking water treatment plants (WTPs) situated in diverse locations from subtropical to temperate climate. The WTPs incorporated various water sources, treatment processes and OM removal efficiencies (DOC removal 0\%‚Äì68\%). Despite these differences, four common fluorescence PARAFAC components were identified for characterisation of OM concentration and treatability. Moreover, fluorescence component ratios showed site-specific statistically significant correlations with OM removal, which contrasted with correlations between specific UV absorbance at 254¬†nm (SUVA) and OM removal that were not statistically significant. This indicates that use of fluorescence spectroscopy may be a more robust alternative for predicting DOC removal than UV spectroscopy. Based on the identified fluorescence components, four optical locations were selected in order to move towards single wavelength online OM monitoring.},

This refractory DOM, largely produced during microbial mineralization of organic matter, includes humic-like substances generated in situ and detectable by fluorescence spectroscopy. Here we show two ubiquitous humic-like fluorophores with turnover times of 435¬±41 and 610¬±55 years, which persist significantly longer than the {\textasciitilde}350 years that the dark global ocean takes to renew. In parallel, decay of a tyrosine-like fluorophore with a turnover time of 379¬±103 years is also detected. We propose the use of DOM fluorescence to study the cycling of resistant DOM that is preserved at centennial timescales and could represent a mechanism of carbon sequestration (humic-like fraction) and the decaying DOM injected into the dark global ocean, where it decreases at centennial timescales (tyrosine-like fraction).},

	abstract = {Urban stormwater ponds are considered to be a best management practice for flood control and the protection of downstream aquatic ecosystems from excess suspended solids and other contaminants. Following this, urban ponds are assumed to operate as unreactive settling basins, whereby their overall effectiveness in water treatment is strictly controlled by physical processes. However, pelagic microbial biogeochemical dynamics could be significant contributors to nutrient and carbon cycling in these small, constructed aquatic systems. In the present study, we examined pelagic biogeochemical dynamics in 26 stormwater ponds located in southern Ontario, Canada, during late summer. Initially, we tested to see if total suspended solids (TSS) concentration, which provides a measure of catchment disturbance, landscape stability, and pond performance, could be used as an indirect predictor of plankton stocks in stormwater ponds. Structural equation modeling (SEM) using TSS as a surrogate for external loading suggested that TSS was an imperfect predictor. TSS masked plankton‚Äìnutrient relationships and appeared to reflect autochthonous production moreso than external forces. When TSS was excluded, the SEM model explained a large amount of the variation in dissolved organic matter (DOM) characteristics (55‚Äì75\%) but a small amount of the variation in plankton stocks (3‚Äì38\%). Plankton stocks were correlated positively with particulate nutrients and extracellular enzyme activities, suggesting rapid recycling of the fixed nutrient and carbon pool with consequential effects on DOM. DOM characteristics across the ponds were mainly of autochthonous origin. Humic matter from the watershed formed a larger part of the DOM pool only in ponds with low productivity and low dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Our results suggest that in these small, high nutrient systems internal processes might outweigh the impact of the landscape on carbon cycles. Hence, the overall benefit that constructed ponds serve to protect downstream environments must be weighed with the biogeochemical processes that take place within the water body, which could offset pond water quality gains by supporting intense microbial metabolism. Finally, TSS did not provide a useful indication of stormwater pond biogeochemistry and was biased by autochthonous production, which could lead to erroneous TSS-based management conclusions regarding pond performance.},

In addition to abiotic inorganic carbon fluxes, an active microbial community produces and remineralizes organic carbon, which can accumulate in sea ice brines as dissolved organic matter (DOM). In this study, the characteristics of DOM fluorescence in Antarctic sea ice brines from the western Weddell Sea were investigated. Two humic-like components were identified, which were identical to those previously found to accumulate in the deep ocean and represent refractory material. Three amino-acid-like signals were found, one of which was unique to the brines and another that was spectrally very similar to tryptophan and found both in seawater and in brine samples. The tryptophan-like fluorescence in the brines exhibited intensities higher than could be explained by conservative behavior during the freezing of seawater. Its fluorescence was correlated with the accumulation of nitrogen-rich DOM to concentrations up to 900 Œºmol L‚àí1 as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and, thus, potentially represented proteins released by ice organisms. A second, nitrogen-poor DOM fraction also accumulated in the brines to concentrations up to 200 Œºmol L‚àí1 but was not correlated with any of the fluorescence signals identified. Because of the high C:N ratio and lack of fluorescence, this material is thought to represent extracellular polymeric substances, which consist primarily of polysaccharides. The clear grouping of the DOM pool into either proteinaceous or carbohydrate-dominated material indicates that the production and accumulation of these two subpools of DOM in sea ice brines is, to some extent, decoupled.},

We hypothesized that in hydrothermal systems DOM molecular composition is modulated by (i) fluid contribution, (ii) thermal decomposition and pH, and (iii) aspects particular to the vent system. Hence, solid phase extracted (SPE) DOM samples collected along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) were molecularly characterized via 15 Tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). The molecular character of an oceanic DOM sample was also determined before and after thermal (300¬∞C) decomposition at acidic and neutral pH. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that DOM composition was strongly influenced by fluid contribution (Mg2+ concentration between 12 and 54mM), which correlated positively with measured temperature (between 8 and 375¬∞C). In comparison, pH of the fluids (between 2.5 and 6.9) had a minor influence. Seafloor pressure, used as a theoretical maximum fluid temperature at the seafloor, separated the fluids collected at Menez Gwen from deeper locations, due to the higher abundance of peptide, carboxyl-rich alicyclic (CRAM) and aromatic molecular formulae at Menez Gwen. Compared with seawater DOM, thermally decomposed DOM had on average lower molecular mass, lower O/C ratios, fewer double bond equivalents, and fewer CRAM formulae but higher aromaticity - the same molecular features displayed by MAR hydrothermal fluids. The study provides evidence that thermal reworking plays a major role in shaping DOM mixtures from hydrothermal fluids along the MAR, which partly represent thermally reworked marine DOM that survived hydrothermal circulation.},

	abstract = {The traditional likelihood-based test for differences in multivariate dispersions is known to be sensitive to nonnormality. It is also impossible to use when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. Many biological and ecological data sets have many variables, are highly skewed, and are zero-inflated. The traditional test and even some more robust alternatives are also unreasonable in many contexts where measures of dispersion based on a non-Euclidean dissimilarity would be more appropriate. Distance-based tests of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions, which can be based on any dissimilarity measure of choice, are proposed here. They rely on the rotational invariance of either the multivariate centroid or the spatial median to obtain measures of spread using principal coordinate axes. The tests are straightforward multivariate extensions of Levene's test, with P-values obtained either using the traditional F-distribution or using permutation of either least-squares or LAD residuals. Examples illustrate the utility of the approach, including the analysis of stabilizing selection in sparrows, biodiversity of New Zealand fish assemblages, and the response of Indonesian reef corals to an El Ni√±o. Monte Carlo simulations from the real data sets show that the distance-based tests are robust and powerful for relevant alternative hypotheses of real differences in spread.},

By tracing both C and N uptake we provide clear evidence that high rates of C uptake are linked to phytoplankton NO3, and not NH4, use. Results from kinetics experiments demonstrated higher specific uptake rates (VMAx) for NO3 compared to NH4 in the SFE. Finally, dissolved inorganic carbon and nutrient drawdown ratios in the enclosures from the chronically high NH4 regions of the SFE were substantially lower than predicted from the Redfield ratio, suggesting suppressed C uptake, in relation to other elemental uptake. Our conceptual model of the DIN interactions that lead to higher primary production and phytoplankton blooms in the SFE suggests that higher rates of primary production that accompany phytoplankton NO3 uptake are sufficient to outpace phytoplankton losses, leading to blooms, compared to the lower rates associated with NH4 uptake (only 20\% of that based upon NO3). Historical changes in wastewater practices have increased the proportion of NH4 to the DIN pool in the SFE leading to reduced access to NO3 by phytoplankton. This may help to explain some of the reduced primary production and phytoplankton biomass observed there since the 1970s.},

	abstract = {The project ‚ÄúClimatic variability and vertical carbon flux in the marginal ice zone in the central Barents Sea‚Äù was initiated to fill some of the gaps in our knowledge on the biological processes related to the dynamic hydrography in the Barents Sea. A previously modelled transect from the Atlantic waters, crossing the Polar Front into the Arctic waters and the MIZ in the central Barents Sea, was investigated to cover the zonal structure and different water masses. The present paper describes the hydrography, nutrients and Chl a distribution in March, May 1998 and July 1999 along this transect. Based on the nutrient consumption, the new production is estimated and discussed as related to topography, water masses and climate change. Atlantic water dominated in south with a Polar Front shaped by the bank topography, and water with more Arctic characteristics in north. A high, uniform nutrient regime in March was depleted giving a spring bloom in May with Chl a accumulation {\textless}100 m in the Atlantic dominated region. The phytoplankton biomass was concentrated in the upper 30 m in the strongly stratified MIZ. The new production estimates for the period ranged 30‚Äì80 g C m‚àí2 (0.5‚Äì1.4 g C m‚àí2 day‚àí1). New production rates were closely related to the mixing depth with highest rates in the deeper mixed Atlantic region and trenches where the Polar Front was located. Non-Si demanding species were more important for new production in the deeper mixed regions. Seasonal changes from May to July was most likely masked by interannual variations as the July cruise took place the following year, characterised as a warmer year than 1998 in the Barents Sea due to increased Atlantic inflow in 1999 A locally produced cold but saline water mass observed on Sentralbanken in March and May resulting from the freezing process in the waters above the bank was replaced by warmer waters in July and the strongly stratified MIZ was pushed further north. Interannually variable hydrographic regimes in different regions influence the new production and the biological community in the Barents Sea.},

In the southern part of the section the bloom starts as the waters become stratified due to a northward spreading of low salinity water from the Norwegian Coastal Current. In the middle part of the section the bloom is initiated when vernal stratification develops due to heating of the ocean surface, and the bloom may develop in either of two directions throughout summer, depending on the prevailing atmospheric pressure gradient over the region. A north to south high to low pressure gradient will direct surface winds to the west. Ekman drift will then be to the north and a wedge of low salinity, low nutrient water will spread out over the region, leading to the termination of the bloom. When the pressure gradient is reversed, winds will blow to the east and intrusion of fresh water into the region will be limited. In these years the bloom appears to follow a classical Atlantic pattern, unable to fully utilize available nitrate and probably terminated due to extensive grazing. The central part of the Barents Sea Opening is thus yet another northern high latitude region where the bloom is subject to substantial interannual variations, potentially affecting higher trophic levels.},

The physical oceanography is dominated by the inÔ¨Çux of warm, high-salinity Atlantic Waters from the south and cold, low-salinity waters from the Arctic. Seasonal ice forms in the Barents Sea with maximum coverage typically in March‚ÄìApril. The total mean annual primary production rates are similar in the Barents and Norwegian Seas (80‚Äì90 g C m√Ä2), although in the Barents, the production is higher in the Atlantic than in the ice covered Arctic Waters. The zooplankton is dominated by Calanus species, C. Ô¨Ånmarchicus in the Atlantic Waters of the Norwegian and Barents Seas, and C. glacialis in the Arctic Waters of the Barents Sea. The Ô¨Åsh species in the Norwegian Sea are mostly pelagics such as herring (Clupea harengus) and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), while in the Barents Sea there are both pelagics (capelin (Mallotus villosus Mu¬® ller), herring, and polar cod (Boreogadus saida Lepechin)) and demersals (cod (Gadus morhua L.) and haddock (Melanogrammus aegleÔ¨Ånus)). The latter two species spawn in the Norwegian Sea along the slope edge (haddock) or along the coast (cod) and drift into the Barents Sea. Marine mammals and seabirds, although comprising only a relatively small percentage of the biomass and production in the region, play an important role as consumers of zooplankton and small Ô¨Åsh. While top-down control by predators certainly is signiÔ¨Åcant within the two regions, there is also ample evidence of bottom-up control. Climate variability inÔ¨Çuences the distribution of several Ô¨Åsh species, such as cod, herring and blue whiting, with northward shifts during extended warm periods and southward movements during cool periods. Climate-driven increases in primary and secondary production also lead to increased Ô¨Åsh production through higher abundance and improved growth rates.},

One cruise was part of the UK Ocean Acidification research programme, and the other was a repeat hydrographic transect of the Extended Ellett Line. In combination with measurements made of other variables on these and other cruises, these data can be used to constrain the anthropogenic component of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the interior ocean, and to help to determine the influence of biological carbon uptake on surface ocean carbonate chemistry. The measurements have been processed, quality-controlled and submitted to an in-preparation global compilation of seawater Œ¥$^{\textrm{13}}$C$_{\textrm{DIC}}$ data, and are available from the British Oceanographic Data Centre. The observed \&delta;$^{\textrm{13}}$C$_{\textrm{DIC}}$ values fall in a range from ‚àí0.58 to +2.37 \&permil;, relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard. The mean of the absolute differences between samples collected in duplicate in the same container type during both cruises and measured consecutively is 0.10 \&permil;, which corresponds to a 1œÉ uncertainty of 0.09 \&permil;, and which is within the range reported by other published studies of this kind. A crossover analysis was performed with nearby historical Œ¥$^{\textrm{13}}$C$_{\textrm{DIC}}$ data, indicating that any systematic offsets between our measurements and previously published results are negligible.

	abstract = {Polar oceans are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification due to their low temperatures and reduced buffering capacity, and are expected to experience extensive low pH conditions and reduced carbonate mineral saturations states (Œ©) in the near future. However, the impact of anthropogenic CO2 on pH and Œ© will vary regionally between and across the Arctic and Southern Oceans. Here we investigate the carbonate chemistry in the Atlantic sector of two polar oceans, the Nordic Seas and Barents Sea in the Arctic Ocean, and the Scotia and Weddell Seas in the Southern Ocean, to determine the physical and biogeochemical processes that control surface pH and Œ©. High-resolution observations showed large gradients in surface pH (0.10‚Äì0.30) and aragonite saturation state (Œ©ar) (0.2‚Äì1.0) over small spatial scales, and these were particularly strong in sea-ice covered areas (up to 0.45 in pH and 2.0 in Œ©ar). In the Arctic, sea-ice melt facilitated bloom initiation in light-limited and iron replete (dFe{\textgreater}0.2nM) regions, such as the Fram Strait, resulting in high pH (8.45) and Œ©ar (3.0) along the sea-ice edge. In contrast, accumulation of dissolved inorganic carbon derived from organic carbon mineralisation under the ice resulted in low pH (8.05) and Œ©ar (1.1) in areas where thick ice persisted. In the Southern Ocean, sea-ice retreat resulted in bloom formation only where terrestrial inputs supplied sufficient iron (dFe{\textgreater}0.2nM), such as in the vicinity of the South Sandwich Islands where enhanced pH (8.3) and Œ©ar (2.3) were primarily due to biological production. In contrast, in the adjacent Weddell Sea, weak biological uptake of CO2 due to low iron concentrations (dFe{\textless}0.2nM) resulted in low pH (8.1) and Œ©ar (1.6). The large spatial variability in both polar oceans highlights the need for spatially resolved surface data of carbonate chemistry variables but also nutrients (including iron) in order to accurately elucidate the large gradients experienced by marine organisms and to understand their response to increased CO2 in the future.},

	abstract = {A widely used degassing method for methane in seawater employing vacuum was tested and subsequently improved. It yielded 62 ¬± 3.8\% of the total dissolved methane, hence a reproducible correction factor was established. The method was then applied to measure CH4 in the sea-air boundary layer and simultaneously in the overlying air along two transects in the eastern Equatorial Pacific off Peru in March of 1992. The results showed surprising small-scale reversals of the methane exchange between ocean and atmosphere in this region. Generally the ocean acted as a source of methane but also methane uptake by the ocean was found. This was mainly a consequence of high CH4 concentrations in the air which deviated considerably from the long-term and large-scale average. If applied to the flux rate calculations, the observed variabilities indicate that both rate and direction of the methane flux through the air-sea interface vary considerably depending on the atmospheric CH4 content. The implications are that even ocean areas with high concentrations of dissolved CH4 can be considerably weaker sources than would be expected on the basis of 1.7 ppmv mean atmospheric methane content. Based on improved simultaneous analyses of both air and water samples, the ocean-atmosphere flux of methane would therefore be more dynamic than previously thought.},

Porewater geochemistry and lipid biomarker signatures revealed clear differences in the geochemical and biogeochemical regimes of this core compared with two additional ones recovered from pockmarks sites at Vestnesa Ridge, which we attribute to differential methane transport mechanisms. In the sediments core featuring the shallow mini-fracture at pockmark Lomvi, we observed high concentrations of both methane and sulfate throughout the core in tandem with moderately elevated values for total alkalinity, $^{\textrm{13}}$C-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and $^{\textrm{13}}$C-depleted lipid biomarkers (diagnostic for the slow-growing microbial communities mediating the anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulfate \&ndash; AOM). In another core recovered from the same pockmark about 80\&thinsp;m away from the fractured core, we observed complete sulfate depletion in the top centimeters of the sediment and much more pronounced signatures of AOM than in the fractured core. Our data indicate a gas advection-dominated transport mode in both cores facilitating methane migration into sulfate-rich surface sediments. However, the more moderate expression of AOM signals suggest a rather recent onset of gas migration at the site of the fractured core, while the geochemical evidence for a well-established AOM community at the second coring site at the Lomvi pockmark suggest that gas migration has been going on for a longer period of time. A third core recovered from Lunde pockmark was dominated by diffusive transport with only weak geochemical and biogeochemical evidence for AOM. Our study highlights that advective fluid and gas transport supported by mini-fractures can be important in modulating methane dynamics in surface sediments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Four pingos associated with seabed methane release hosted diverse biological communities of mainly nonseep (background) species including commercially important fish and crustaceans, as well as a species new to this area (the snow crab \textit{Chionoecetes opilio}). We attribute the presence of most benthic community members to habitat heterogeneity and the occurrence of hard substrates (methane-derived authigenic carbonates), particularly the most abundant phyla (Cnidaria and Porifera), though food availability and exposure to a diverse microbial community is also important for certain taxa. Only one chemosynthesis-based species was confirmed, the siboglinid frenulate polychaete \textit{Oligobrachia} cf. \textit{haakonmosbiensis}. Overall, the pingo communities formed two distinct clusters, distinguished by the presence or absence of frenulate aggregations. Methane gas advection through sediments was low, below the single pingo that lacked frenulate aggregations, while seismic profiles indicated abundant gas-saturated sediment below the other frenulate-colonized pingos. The absence of frenulate aggregations could not be explained by sediment sulfide concentrations, despite these worms likely containing sulfide-oxidizing symbionts. We propose that high levels of seafloor methane seepage linked to subsurface gas reservoirs support an abundant and active sediment methanotrophic community that maintains high sulfide fluxes and serves as a carbon source for frenulate worms. The pingo currently lacking a large subsurface gas source and lower methane concentrations likely has lower sulfide flux rates and limited amounts of carbon, insufficient to support large populations of frenulates. Two previously undocumented behaviors were visible through the images: grazing activity of snow crabs on bacterial mats, and seafloor crawling of \textit{Nothria conchylega} onuphid polychaetes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Active heterotrophic bacterial communities exist in all marine environments, and although their growth rates or respiratory rates may be limited by the interaction of low substrate concentrations with temperatures near their lower limit for growth, temperature and substrate concentrations are rarely considered together as limiting factors. Moreover, attempts to evaluate metabolic limits by both temperature and substrate concentration have sometimes led to confusing conclusions, because, while we can measure dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in natural waters, much of it is not readily available to heterotrophic bacteria. In spite of this procedural limitation, it can be helpful to regard temperature and substrate concentration as potential limiting factors that interact. In temperate ocean surface waters and estuarine waters, where bacterial growth is often reduced in winter, growth and respiration may be increased experimentally either by raising the temperature or by increasing organic substrate concentrations, providing indirect evidence that the limitation is an effect of temperature on substrate uptake or assimilation. Experimental work with bacterial isolates also has shown a temperature-substrate interaction. In permanently cold polar waters, most heterotrophic bacteria appear to be living at temperatures well below their optima for growth. Nevertheless, bacteria in permanently cold surface waters can achieve activity rates in summer that are as high as those in temperate waters. In sea ice, rates of bacterial production are most often low, even though concentrations of substrates, including free amino acids, are sometimes much higher than they are in seawater. This suggests that at sea ice temperatures heterotrophic bacteria have lowered ability to take up or utilize organic substrates.},

	abstract = {The Vestnesa Ridge is a NW-SE trending, {\textasciitilde}100km-long, 1‚Äì2km-thick contourite sediment section located in the Arctic Ocean, west of Svalbard, at 79¬∞N. Pockmarks align along the ridge summit at water depths of {\textasciitilde}1200m; they are {\textasciitilde}700m in diameter and {\textasciitilde}10m deep relative to the surrounding seafloor. Observations of methane seepage in this area have been reported since 2008. Here we summarize and integrate the available information to date and report on the first detailed seafloor imaging and camera-guided multicore sampling at two of the most active pockmarks along Vestnesa Ridge, named Lomvi and Lunde. We correlate seafloor images with seismically defined subseafloor structures, providing a geological and ecological context to better understand pockmark formation. Subbottom and seismic surveys, water column imaging, geochemical data and seafloor observations indicate ongoing fluid flow at these pockmarks. Visual inspection and sampling using a high-resolution deep-sea camera and multicorer system show exposed gas hydrate and authigenic carbonate in association with biota within two of these pockmarks. Distributed methane venting at both Lomvi and Lunde supports extensive chemosynthetic communities that include filamentous sulfide-oxidizing bacteria and siboglinid tubeworms, all of which utilize chemical energy provided by the seeping fluids. Focused venting forms shallow gas hydrate, and sustains localized gas discharge from 50-m wide pits within the pockmarks. Cycles of carbonate precipitation and/or exhumation of carbonate deposits are indicated by scattered blocks of various size, pavements, and massive carbonate blocks up to 3m high. Consistent with other observations along continental margin settings, we show that the extensive authigenic carbonate deposits in the Vestnesa pockmarks represent an important and prolonged methane carbon sink that prevents much of the upwardly flowing methane from reaching the overlying ocean.},

	abstract = {Abstract In 2014, the discovery of seafloor mounds leaking methane gas into the water column in the northwestern Barents Sea became the first to document the existence of nonpermafrost-related gas hydrate pingos (GHPs) on the Eurasian Arctic shelf. The discovered site is given attention because the gas hydrates occur close to the upper limit of the gas hydrate stability, thus may be vulnerable to climatic forcing. In addition, this site lies on the regional Hornsund Fault Zone marking a transition between the oceanic and continental crust. The Hornsund Fault Zone is known to coincide with an extensive seafloor gas seepage area; however, until now lack of seismic data prevented connecting deep structural elements to shallow seepages. Here we use high-resolution P-Cable 3-D seismic data to study the subsurface architecture of GHPs and underlying glacial and preglacial deposits. The data show gas hydrates, authigenic carbonates, and free gas within the GHPs on top of gas chimneys piercing a thin section of low-permeability glacial sediments. The chimneys connect to faults within the underlying tilted and folded fluid and gas-hydrate-bearing sedimentary rocks. Correlation of our data with regional 2-D seismic surveys shows a spatial connection between the shallow subsurface fluid flow system and the deep-seated regional fault zone. We suggest that fault-controlled Paleocene hydrocarbon reservoirs inject methane into the low-permeability glacial deposits and near-seabed sediments, forming the GHPs. This conceptual model explains the existence of climate-sensitive gas hydrate inventories and extensive seabed methane release observed along the Svalbard-Barents Sea margin.},

Porewater geochemistry and lipid biomarker signatures revealed clear differences in the geochemical and biogeochemical regimes of this core compared with two additional unfractured cores recovered from pockmark sites at Vestnesa Ridge, which we attribute to differential methane transport mechanisms. In the sediment core featuring the shallow mini-fracture at pockmark Lomvi, we observed high concentrations of both methane and sulfate throughout the core in tandem with moderately elevated values for total alkalinity, {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{13}}$C{\textless}/span{\textgreater}-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{13}}$C{\textless}/span{\textgreater}-depleted lipid biomarkers (diagnostic for the slow-growing microbial communities mediating the anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulfate ‚Äì AOM). In a separate unfractured core, recovered from the same pockmark about 80\&thinsp;m away from the fractured core, we observed complete sulfate depletion in the top centimeters of the sediment and much more pronounced signatures of AOM than in the fractured core. Our data indicate a gas advection-dominated transport mode in both cores, facilitating methane migration into sulfate-rich surface sediments. However, the moderate expression of AOM signals suggest a rather recent onset of gas migration at the site of the fractured core, while the geochemical evidence for a well-established AOM community at the second coring site suggest that gas migration has been going on for a longer period of time. A third core recovered from another pockmark along the Vestnesa Ridge Lunde pockmark was dominated by diffusive transport with only weak geochemical and biogeochemical evidence for AOM. Our study highlights that advective fluid and gas transport supported by mini-fractures can be important in modulating methane dynamics in surface sediments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Non-targeted ultrahigh resolution 12‚ÄØT negative mode electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) revealed high molecular diversity in solid-phase extracted and ionizable components of Microcystis aeruginosa ADOM. The toxin microcystin LR was effectively degraded by free chlorine, which was expected. However, we found a high diversity of disinfection by-products associated with the addition of free chlorine to the water-soluble and solid-phase extractable fraction of ADOM and of double-bond moieties in abundant and known unsaturated fatty acids. Aromatic DOM precursors were absent from known metabolites of Microcystis aeruginosa and no evidence for aromatic disinfection by-products (DBPs) was found, despite N-containing compounds. A large diversification of N-containing molecular formulas was observed after chlorination, which seems indicative for the breakdown and oxidation of larger peptides. Additionally, a diverse group of N-compounds with presumed chloramine functional groups was observed. This study highlights the importance to evaluate ADOM and its ability to form different DBPs when compared to allochthonous or terrestrially-derived DOM.},

The N : P ratio of algae and cyanobacteria is very plastic in nutrient-limited cells, ranging from 5 mol N : mol P when phosphate is available greatly in excess of nitrate or ammonium to 100 mol N : mol P when inorganic N is present greatly in excess of P. Under optimal nutrient-replete growth conditions, the cellular N : P ratio is somewhat more constrained, ranging from 5 to 19 mol N : mol P, with most observations below the RedÔ¨Åeld ratio of 16. Limited data indicate that the critical N : P that marks the transition between N- and P-limitation of phytoplankton growth lies in the range 20‚Äì50 mol N : mol P, considerably in excess of the RedÔ¨Åeld ratio. Biochemical composition can be used to constrain the critical N : P. Although the biochemical data do not preclude the critical N : P from being as high as 50, the typical biochemical composition of nutrient-replete algae and cyanobacteria suggests that the critical N : P is more likely to lie in the range between 15 and 30. Despite the observation that the overall average N : P composition of marine particulate matter closely approximates the RedÔ¨Åeld ratio of 16, there are signiÔ¨Åcant local variations with a range from 5 to 34. Consistent with the culture studies, lowest values of N : P are associated with nitrate- and phosphate-replete conditions. The highest values of N : P are observed in oligotrophic waters and are within the range of critical N : P observed in cultures, but are not so high as to necessarily invoke P-limitation. The C : N ratio is also plastic. The average C : N ratios of nutrientreplete phytoplankton cultures, oceanic particulate matter and inorganic N and C draw-down are slightly greater than the RedÔ¨Åeld ratio of 6n6. Neither the analysis of laboratory C : N : P data nor a more theoretical approach based on the relative abundance of the major biochemical molecules in the phytoplankton can support the contention that the RedÔ¨Åeld N : P reÔ¨Çects a physiological or biochemical constraint on the elemental composition of primary production.},

In addition, we measured stable carbon isotope ratios in particulate organic matter (POM), surface sediments, zooplankton, and methane. MBP corresponded to 0.3‚Äì7\% of the organic C production by primary producers, and 0.5‚Äì17\% of HBP during summer. During winter, MBP was 3‚Äì120\% of HBP.

Unlike the other macro-infaunal assemblages, the ampharetid-bed assemblage composition was homogeneous, independent of location. Based on a mixing model of species-specific mass and isotopic composition, combined with published respiration measurements, we estimated that this community consumes 29‚Äì90 mmol C m‚àí2 d‚àí1 of methane-fueled biomass; this is {\textgreater} 290 times the carbon fixed by anaerobic methane oxidizers in these ampharetid beds. A fatty acid biomarker approach supported the finding that this community, unlike those previously known, consumes primarily aerobic methanotrophic bacteria. Due to the novel microbial fueling and high methane flux rates, New Zealand's ampharetid beds provide a model system to study the influence of metazoan grazing on microbially mediated biogeochemical cycles, including those that involve greenhouse gas emissions.},

	abstract = {Large amounts of methane are produced in marine sediments but are then consumed before contacting aerobic waters or the atmosphere1. Although no organism that can consume methane anaerobically has ever been isolated, biogeochemical evidence indicates that the overall process involves a transfer of electrons from methane to sulphate and is probably mediated by several organisms, including a methanogen (operating in reverse) and a sulphate-reducer (using an unknown intermediate substrate)2. Here we describe studies of sediments related to a decomposing methane hydrate. These provide strong evidence that methane is being consumed by archaebacteria that are phylogenetically distinct from known methanogens. Specifically, lipid biomarkers that are commonly characteristic of archaea are so strongly depleted in carbon-13 that methane must be the carbon source, rather than the metabolic product, for the organisms that have produced them. Parallel gene surveys of small-subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) indicate the predominance of a new archael group which is peripherally related to the methanogenic orders Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales.},

	abstract = {In this study we investigated by using 16S rRNA-based methods the distribution and biomass of archaea in samples from (i) sediments above outcropping methane hydrate at Hydrate Ridge (Cascadia margin off Oregon) and (ii) massive microbial mats enclosing carbonate reefs (Crimea area, Black Sea). The archaeal diversity was low in both locations; there were only four (Hydrate Ridge) and five (Black Sea) different phylogenetic clusters of sequences, most of which belonged to the methanotrophic archaea (ANME). ANME group 2 (ANME-2) sequences were the most abundant and diverse sequences at Hydrate Ridge, whereas ANME-1 sequences dominated the Black Sea mats. Other seep-specific sequences belonged to the newly defined group ANME-3 (related to Methanococcoides spp.) and to the Crenarchaeota of marine benthic group B. Quantitative analysis of the samples by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that ANME-1 and ANME-2 co-occurred at the cold seep sites investigated. At Hydrate Ridge the surface sediments were dominated by aggregates consisting of ANME-2 and members of the Desulfosarcina-Desulfococcus branch (DSS) (ANME-2/DSS aggregates), which accounted for {\textgreater}90\% of the total cell biomass. The numbers of ANME-1 cells increased strongly with depth; these cells accounted 1\% of all single cells at the surface and more than 30\% of all single cells (5\% of the total cells) in 7- to 10-cm sediment horizons that were directly above layers of gas hydrate. In the Black Sea microbial mats ANME-1 accounted for about 50\% of all cells. ANME-2/DSS aggregates occurred in microenvironments within the mat but accounted for only 1\% of the total cells. FISH probes for the ANME-2a and ANME-2c subclusters were designed based on a comparative 16S rRNA analysis. In Hydrate Ridge sediments ANME-2a/DSS and ANME-2c/DSS aggregates differed significantly in morphology and abundance. The relative abundance values for these subgroups were remarkably different at Beggiatoa sites (80\% ANME-2a, 20\% ANME-2c) and Calyptogena sites (20\% ANME-2a, 80\% ANME-2c), indicating that there was preferential selection of the groups in the two habitats. These variations in the distribution, diversity, and morphology of methanotrophic consortia are discussed with respect to the presence of microbial ecotypes, niche formation, and biogeography.},

Here we present the first combined organic geochemical and molecular ecology data on a water column profile of the western Black Sea. We show that aerobic methanotrophs type I are responsible for methane oxidation in the oxic water column and ANME-1- and ANME-2-related organisms for anaerobic methane oxidation. The occurrence of methanotrophs type I cells in the anoxic zone suggests that inactive cells settle to deeper waters. Molecular and biomarker results suggest that a clear distinction between the occurrence of ANME-1- and ANME-2-related lineages exists, i.e. ANME-1-related organisms are responsible for anaerobic methane oxidation below 600 m water depth, whereas ANME-2-related organisms are responsible for this process in the anoxic water column above approximately 600 m water depth.},

	abstract = {Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex mixture of chemical compounds. At 750 Pg C, it is one of the biggest pools of reduced carbon on Earth. It has been proposed that the diversity of DOM is responsible for its recalcitrance. We hypothesize that the chemodiversity of marine DOM is a reflection of the chemodiversity of bacterial exometabolomes. To test this, we incubated two model strains of the Roseobacter group; Phaeobacter inhibens and Dinoroseobacter shibae in pure culture using three different simple organic compounds as sole carbon sources (glutamate, glucose, and acetate and succinate for P. inhibens and D. shibae, respectively). The exometabolome of the model organisms was characterized using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and ecological diversity measures. We detected thousands of molecular masses in the exometabolomes of P. inhibens and D. shibae (21,105 and 9,386, respectively), reflecting the capability of single bacterial strains to diversify simple organic compounds. The chemical composition of the exometabolomes changed with growth phase and also differed according to the strain incubated and the utilized substrate. We mimicked a higher diversity of substrates, bacterial species and heterogeneous growth (different growth phases) to approach the complexity of natural environments, by computationally creating combinations of detected exometabolomes. We compared the chemodiversity of these combinations, indicative for chemodiversity of freshly produced microbial DOM to that of refractory DOM from one of the oldest oceanic water masses (North Equatorial Pacific Intermediate Water). Some combinations of exometabolomes showed higher richness than the deep ocean refractory DOM, and all of them showed higher functional diversity. About 15\% of the 13,509 molecular formulae detected in exometabolomes and refractory oceanic DOM were shared, i.e. occurred in Roseobacter exometabolomes and in deep water samples. This overlap provides further support for our hypothesis that marine bacteria from the Roseobacter group sustain marine DOM chemodiversity and stability.},

Current observations for the upper ‚àº200 m show mostly a barotropic flow, enhanced over the shallow Yermak Plateau. The two branches of inflowing Atlantic Water are partly captured, confirming that the outer Yermak Branch follows the perimeter of the plateau, and the inner Svalbard Branch the coast. Atlantic Water observed to be warmer and shallower than in the climatology, is found directly below the mixed layer down to 800 m depth, and is warmest along the slope, while its properties inside the basin are quite homogeneous. From late May onwards, the drift was continually close to the ice edge and a thinner surface mixed layer and shallower Atlantic Water coincided with significant sea ice melt being observed.},

Here we use a multi-pronged systems-level approach to reassess the metabolic functions for methane utilization in a promising bacterial biocatalyst. We demonstrate that methane assimilation is coupled with a highly efficient pyrophosphate-mediated glycolytic pathway, which under oxygen limitation participates in a novel form of fermentation-based methanotrophy. This surprising discovery suggests a novel mode of methane utilization in oxygen-limited environments, and opens new opportunities for a modular approach towards producing a variety of excreted chemical products using methane as a feedstock.},

The main food source of these benthic organisms is supplied by symbiotic chemosynthetic activity of sulfur oxidizing bacteria. Biomarker lipids such as hydrocarbons, were analyzed to describe their sources and composition and also the relationships among microorganisms, biological communities, and dissolved and particulate organic materials in this productive area. The organic matter of vent waters is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from the non-vent bottom water. Dissolved hydrocarbon concentrations in warm water (T ‚àº 15¬∞C) from fissures in basalts and hot clear water (T {\textgreater} 250¬∞C) from smokers are 100 and 400 times more concentrated, respectively, than the water outside active areas. The biomarker compounds from hot clear water are characteristic of thermally mature organic matter as indicated by the 17Œ±(H)- {\textgreater} 17Œ≤(H)-hopane series, and the dominance of 5Œ±(H), 14Œ≤(H), 17Œ≤(H)-steranes over the 5Œ±(H), 14Œ±(H), 17Œ±(H), 20R-steranes, i.e. the biologically inherited configuration. The dissolved hydrocarbons from the warm waters may be correlated with bacterial lipid residues as indicated by the presence of isoprenoid hydrocarbons (pristane {\textgreater} phytane) and low molecular weight cyclic hydrocarbons. The water column samples collected near hydrothermally active areas contain bicyclic alkanes with drimane and rearranged drimane skeletons and mature biomarkers (17Œ±(H)-hopanes and Œ±Œ≤Œ≤-steranes). These components probably derived from thermally-altered microbial sources. The dissolved lipid matter is found to be degraded more rapidly by microbial activity and thermal processes, especially in the warm water effluent and in the water column around hydrothermal vents, than the lipids of the particulate matter.},

	abstract = {In this study, electrospray ionization coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) is utilized to molecularly characterize DOM as it is transported along a river to estuary to ocean transect of the lower Chesapeake Bay system. The ultrahigh resolving power (greater than 500,000) and mass accuracy of FTICR-MS allow for the resolution of the thousands of components in a single DOM sample, and can therefore elucidate the molecular-level changes that occur during DOM transformation from a terrestrial location to the marine environment. An important feature of FTICR-MS is that its sensitivity allows for direct analysis of low salinity samples without employing the traditional concentration approaches involving C18 extraction or ultrafiltration. To evaluate the advantages of using direct analysis, a C18 extract of riverine water is compared to its whole, unfractionated water, and it was determined that the C18 extraction is selective in that it eliminates two major series of compounds. One group is aliphatic amines/amides that are not adsorbed to the C18 disk because they exist as positive ions prior to extraction. The second group is tannin-like compounds with higher oxygen contents and a more polar quality that also allow them not to be adsorbed to the C18 disk. This direct approach could not be used for brackish/saline waters, so the C18 method is resorted to for those samples. Along the subject transect, a significant difference is observed in the molecular composition of DOM, as determined from assigned molecular formulas. The DOM tends to become more aliphatic and contain lower abundances of oxygen-rich molecules as one progresses from inshore to the offshore. A considerable amount of molecular formula overlap does exist between samples from sites along the transect. This can be explained as either the presence of refractory material that persists throughout the transect, due to its resistance to degradation, or that the assigned molecular formulas are the same but the chemical structures are different. ESI-FTICR-MS is a powerful technique for the investigation of DOM and has the ability to detect compositional variations along the river to ocean transect. Visualization tools such as two dimensional and three dimensional van Krevelen diagrams greatly assist in highlighting the shift from the more aromatic, terrestrial DOM to the more aliphatic, marine DOM.},

We quantified the relative abundances of monophosphate nucleotides and their corresponding nucleosides, using a combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomics methods. Under P-deficient conditions, we observed a marked decrease in adenosine 5‚Ä≤-monophosphate (AMP) with a concomitant increase in adenosine. This shift occurred within all detected pairs of monophosphate nucleotides and nucleosides, and was consistent with previous work showing transcriptional changes in nucleotide synthesis and salvage under P-deficient conditions for model eukaryotes. In the field, we observed AMP-to-adenosine ratios that were similar to those in laboratory culture under P-deficient conditions.},

Metabolomics has been used in biomedical applications as well as environmental studies that explore ecological and biogeochemical questions. We have developed a targeted metabolomics method using electrospray ionization‚Äìliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to analyze metabolites dissolved in seawater. Preparation of samples from the marine environment presents challenges because dilute metabolites must be concentrated and desalted. We present the extraction efficiencies of 89 metabolites in our targeted method using solid phase extraction (SPE). In addition, we calculate the limits of detection and quantification for the metabolites in the method and compare the instrument response factors in five different matrices ranging from deionized water to spent medium from cultured marine microbes. High background organic matter content reduces the instrument response factor for only a small group of metabolites, yet enhances the extraction efficiency for other metabolites on the SPE cartridge used here, a modified styrene-divinylbenzene polymer called PPL. Aromatic or larger uncharged compounds, in particular, are reproducibly well retained on the PPL polymer. This method is suitable for the detection of dissolved metabolites in marine samples, with limits of detection ranging from {\textless} 1 pM to ‚àº 2 nM dependent on the dual impacts of seawater matrix on extraction efficiency and on instrument response factors.},

A vast number of compounds are present in DOM, and they play important roles in all major element cycles, contribute to the storage of atmospheric CO2 in the ocean, support marine ecosystems, and facilitate interactions between organisms. At the heart of the DOM cycle lie molecular-level relationships between the individual compounds in DOM and the members of the ocean microbiome that produce and consume them. In the past, these connections have eluded clear definition because of the sheer numerical complexity of both DOM molecules and microorganisms. Emerging tools in analytical chemistry, microbiology, and informatics are breaking down the barriers to a fuller appreciation of these connections. Here we highlight questions being addressed using recent methodological and technological developments in those fields and consider how these advances are transforming our understanding of some of the most important reactions of the marine carbon cycle.},

In this article, the strong hydrophilic components, which cannot be extracted by the hydrophobic reverse phase SPE, were further extracted in a natural organic matter sample by ion exchange SPE cartridges to obtain hydrophilic acid (HIA), hydrophilic neutral (HIN), and hydrophilic base (HIB) fractions. The extracts were characterized by three-dimensional excitation‚Äìemission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy and negative-ion electrospray Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS). The results revealed that the hydrophilic components were significantly different from the hydrophobic components in molecular composition. Hydrophilic components were identified as tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like compounds by three-dimensional fluorescence spectra. The HIA fraction contains mainly tannic acid-like compounds with high O/C ratio; the HIB fraction contains mainly amide-like compounds; and the HIN fraction contains mainly lignin and lipids.},

Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) enables the analysis of polar compounds, which is a valuable alternative to reversed-phase liquid chromatography in the field of metabolomics due to its ability to retain a greater portion of the polar metabolome. The objective of the study was to find the optimal chromatographic solution to perform non-targeted metabolomics of feces by means of HILIC ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The performance was systematically investigated analyzing a pooled fecal sample, and mixtures of 150 metabolites from different families, including for example amino acids, amines, indole derivatives, fatty acids and carbohydrates. Three different stationary phases (zwitterionic, amide and unbonded silica) were operated at three pH values (4.6, 6.8 and 9.0), and three salt gradient conditions (5‚Äì5, 5‚Äì10 and 5‚Äì25‚ÄØmM ammonium acetate). Amide and zwitterionic stationary phases performed similarly at low pH, with highest number of detected standards, which increased by increasing the salt gradient. The amide column showed slightly better performance in terms of separation of isomers and peak widths and remarkably good performance at basic pH, with highest number of metabolite features in the non-targeted analysis. The zwitterionic column operated best in terms of number of detected standards, retention time distribution of standards and metabolite feature across whole chromatographic run. Thus, the zwitterionic column was proven to suit for non-targeted analysis of fecal samples, resulting in good coverage of especially amino acids and carbohydrates.},

Fjords are particularly important shelf areas for carbon burial due to relatively high sedimentation rates and high organic matter fluxes. As terrigenous organic matter is more resistant to remineralization than marine organic matter, a comprehensive knowledge of the carbon source is critical to better constrain the efficiency of organic carbon burial in fjord sediments. Here we investigated highly productive fjords in northern Norway and compare our results with both existing and new organic carbon to organic nitrogen ratios and carbon stable isotope compositions from fjords in mid-Norway, west Svalbard, and east Greenland. The marine organic carbon contribution varies significantly between these fjords, and the contribution of marine organic carbon in Norwegian fjords is much larger than previously suggested for fjords in NW Europe and also globally. Additionally, northern Norwegian fjords show very high marine carbon burial rates (73.6 gC ¬∑ m-2 ¬∑ year-1) suggesting that these fjords are probably very distinct carbon burial hotspots. We argue that the North Atlantic Current inflow sustains these high burial rates and changes in the current strength due to ongoing climate change are likely to have a pronounced effect on carbon burial in North Atlantic fjords.},

Viral lysis of picocyanobacteria is a major driving force converting biologically fixed carbon into dissolved organic carbon¬†(DOC). Viral-induced dissolved organic matter (vDOM) released from picocyanobacteria provides complex organic matter to bacterioplankton in the marine ecosystem. In order to understand how picocyanobacterial vDOM are transformed by bacteria and the impact of this process on bacterial community structure, viral lysate of picocyanobacteria was incubated with coastal seawater for 90 days. The transformation of vDOM was analyzed by ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and the shift of bacterial populations analyzed using high-throughput sequencing technology. Addition of picocyanobacterial vDOM introduced abundant nitrogen components into the coastal water, which were largely degraded during the 90 days‚Äô incubation period. However, some DOM signatures were accumulated and the total assigned formulae number increased over time. In contrast to the control (no addition of vDOM), bacterial community enriched with vDOM changed markedly with increased biodiversity indices. The network analysis showed that key bacterial species formed complex relationship with vDOM components, suggesting the potential correspondence between bacterial populations and DOM molecules. We demonstrate that coastal bacterioplankton are able to quickly utilize and transform lysis products of picocyanobacteria, meanwhile, bacterial community varies with changing chemodiverisity of DOM. vDOM released from picocyanobacteria generated a complex labile DOM pool, which was converted to a rather stable DOM pool after microbial processing in the time frame of days to weeks.},

Over one-quarter of permafrost OC is stored in deep, ice-rich Pleistocene-aged yedoma permafrost deposits. We used a combination of anaerobic incubations, microbial sequencing, and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to show yedoma OC biolability increases with depth along a 12-m yedoma profile. In incubations at 3 ¬∞C and 13 ¬∞C, GHG production per unit OC at 12 m depth versus 1.3 m depth was 4.6 and 20.5 times greater, respectively. Bacterial diversity decreased with depth and we detected methanogens at all our sampled depths, suggesting that in situ microbial communities are equipped to metabolize thawed OC into CH4. We concurrently observed an increase in the relative abundance of reduced, saturated OC compounds, which corresponded to high proportions of C mineralization and positively correlated with anaerobic GHG production potentials and higher proportions of OC being mineralized as CH4. Taking into account the higher global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 compared to CO2, thawed yedoma sediments in our study had 2 times higher GWP at 12 m depth versus 9.0 m depth at 3 ¬∞C and 15 times higher GWP at 13 ¬∞C. Considering yedoma is vulnerable to processes that thaw deep OC, our findings imply it is important to account for this increasing GHG production and GWP with depth to better understand the disproportionate impact of yedoma on the magnitude of the permafrost carbon feedback.},

	abstract = {Rationale High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) with high sample throughput has become an important analytical tool for the analysis of highly complex samples and data processing has become a major challenge for the user community. Evaluating direct-infusion HRMS data without automated tools for batch processing can be a time-consuming step in the analytical pipeline. Therefore, we developed a new browser-based software tool for processing HRMS data. Methods The software, named UltraMassExplorer (UME), was written in the R programming language using the shiny library to build the graphical user interface. The performance of the integrated formula library search algorithm was tested using HRMS data derived from analyses of up to 50 extracts of marine dissolved organic matter. Results The software supports the processing of lists of calibrated masses of neutral, protonated or deprotonated molecules, with masses of up to 700 Da and a mass accuracy {\textless}3 ppm. In the performance test, the number of assigned peaks per second increased with the number of submitted peaks and reached a maximum rate of 4745 assigned peaks per second.

	abstract = {Carbon is one of the key elements in organisms and non-living compounds on Earth. Carbon dioxide and methane are important greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) determine water biogeochemistry, and carbonates are major constituents of marine sediments. Stable carbon isotope ratios (13C/12C), expressed as Œ¥13C values, are widely used in Modern Earth sciences. Œ¥13CCO2 values of atmospheric carbon dioxide reflect global climate evolution and change. Marine Œ¥13CDIC is used as water-mass tracer and helps quantifying the anthropogenic CO2 uptake of the ocean. The Œ¥13C values of fossil planktic and benthic carbonates indicate changes in circulation pattern and deep-water ventilation of ancient oceans, as well as paleoproductivity at the sea surface and methane release at the sea floor. The Œ¥13COM values of sedimentary organic matter (OM) and compound-specific Œ¥13C values of molecular organic biomarkers indicate whether the organic carbon is of marine or terrestrial provenience. Secular Œ¥13C variations and excursions in carbonates are important stratigraphic marker and tie points. Here we review the application of stable carbon isotope ratios in ocean water and biogenic carbonates as proxies in paleoceanography, including the atmospheric and sedimentary reservoirs oceanic carbon is in exchange with. Due to the wide use of Œ¥13C values in Earth sciences, this overview necessarily does not claim to be complete; rather we focus on field-based stable carbon isotope research and its significance in paleoceanography. This may assist in evaluating general circulation model results and foster development of new innovative proxies.},

Here, we describe two biofilm communities discovered in sediment cores recovered from Arctic cold seep sites (gas hydrate pingos) in the north-western Barents Sea, characterized by steady methane fluxes. We found macroscopically visible biofilms in pockets in the sediment matrix at the depth of the sulphate-methane-transition zone. 16S rRNA gene surveys revealed that the microbial community in one of the two biofilms comprised exclusively of putative anaerobic methanotrophic archaea of which ANME-1 was the sole archaeal taxon. The bacterial community consisted of relatives of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) belonging to uncultured Desulfobacteraceae clustering into SEEP-SRB1 (i.e. the typical SRB associated to ANME-1), and members of the atribacterial JS1 clade. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrates that this biofilm is composed of multicellular strands and patches of ANME-1 that are loosely associated with SRB cells, but not tightly connected in aggregates. Our discovery of methanotrophic biofilms in sediment pockets closely associated with methane seeps constitutes a hitherto overlooked and potentially widespread sink for methane and sulphate in marine sediments.},

	abstract = {Methods for measuring aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) rates in aquatic environments are often based on the incubation of water samples, during which the consumption of methane (CH4) is monitored. Typically, incubation vessels are sealed with butyl rubber because these elastomers are essentially impermeable for gases. We report on the potential toxicity of five different commercially available, lab-grade butyl stoppers on MOx activity in samples from marine and lacustrine environments. MOx rates in incubations sealed with non-halogenated butyl were {\textgreater} 50\% lower compared to parallel incubations with halogenated butyl rubber stoppers, suggesting toxic effects associated with the use of the non-halogenated butyl type. Aqueous extracts of non-halogenated butyl rubber were contaminated with high amounts of various organic compounds including potential bactericides such as benzyltoluenes and phenylalkanes. Comparably small amounts of organic contaminants were liberated from the halogenated butyl rubber stoppers but only two halogenated stopper types were found that did not seem to leach any organics into the incubation medium. Furthermore, the non-halogenated and two types of the halogenated butyl elastomers additionally leached comparably high amounts of zinc. While the source of the apparent toxicity with the use of the non-halogenated rubber stoppers remains elusive, our results indicate that leaching of contaminants from some butyl rubber stoppers can severely interfere with the activity of MOx communities, highlighting the importance of testing rubber stoppers for their respective contamination potential. The impact of leachates from butyl rubber on the assessment of biogeochemical reaction rates other than MOx seems likely but needs to be verified.},

Recently, it has been shown that Streptophyte glacier algae blooming on the surface ice of the south-western coast of the Greenland Ice Sheet are a significant contributor to the 15-year marked decrease in albedo. Currently, little is known about the constraints, such as nutrient availability, on this large-scale algal bloom. In this study, we investigate the relative abundances of dissolved inorganic and dissolved organic macronutrients (N and P) in these darkening surface ice environments. Three distinct ice surfaces, with low, medium and high visible impurity loadings, supraglacial stream water and cryoconite hole water, were sampled. Our results show a clear dominance of the organic phase in all ice surface samples containing low, medium and high visible impurity loadings, with 93\&thinsp;\% of the total dissolved nitrogen and 67\&thinsp;\% of the total dissolved phosphorus in the organic phase.

DON concentrations in all three surface ice samples are significantly higher than DON concentrations in supraglacial streams and cryoconite hole water (0 and 0.7\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}¬µ{\textless}/span{\textgreater}M, respectively). DOP concentrations are higher in all three surface ice samples compared to supraglacial streams and cryoconite hole water (0.07\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}¬µ{\textless}/span{\textgreater}M for both). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations increase with the amount of visible impurities present (low: 83\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}¬µ{\textless}/span{\textgreater}M, medium: 173\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}¬µ{\textless}/span{\textgreater}M and high: 242\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}¬µ{\textless}/span{\textgreater}M) and are elevated compared to supraglacial streams and cryoconite hole water (30 and 50\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}¬µ{\textless}/span{\textgreater}M, respectively). We speculate that the architecture of the weathering crust, which impacts on water flow paths and storage in the melting surface ice and/or the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), containing both N and P in conjunction with C, is responsible for the temporary retention of DON and DOP in the melting surface ice.

A combination of poor microfossil preservation and a limited range in the sediment record may severely restrict the accuracy of resulting RSL reconstructions. Organic Œ¥13C and C/N analysis of inter-tidal sediments have shown some potential as coastal palaeoenvironmental proxies. Here we assess their viability for reconstructing RSL change by examining patterns of organic Œ¥13C and C/N values in a modern estuarine environment. Œ¥13C and C/N analysis of bulk organic inter-tidal sediments and vegetation, as well as suspended and bedload organic sediments of the Mersey Estuary, U.K., demonstrate that the two main sources of organic carbon to surface saltmarsh sediments (terrestrial vegetation and tidal-derived particulate organic matter) have distinctive Œ¥13C and C/N signatures. The resulting relationship between ground elevation within the tidal frame and surface sediment Œ¥13C and C/N is unaffected by decompositional changes. The potential of this technique for RSL reconstruction is demonstrated by the analysis of part of an early Holocene sediment core from the Mersey Estuary. Organic Œ¥13C and C/N analysis is less time consuming than microfossil analysis and is likely to provide continuous records of RSL change.},

	abstract = {Tangential-flow ultrafiltration was used to isolate particulate and high-molecular-weight dissolved material from seawater collected at various depths and geographic regions of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Ultrafiltration proved to be a relatively fast and efficient method for the isolation of hundreds of milligrams of material. Optical and electron microscopy of the isolated materials revealed that relatively fragile materials were recovered intact. Depth-weighted results of the size distribution of organic matter in seawater indicated that {\textasciitilde} 75\% of marine organic carbon was low-molecular-weight (LMW) dissolved organic carbon ({\textless} 1 nm), {\textasciitilde} 24\% was high-molecular-weight (HMW) dissolved organic carbon (1‚Äì100 nm), and {\textasciitilde} 1\% was particulate organic carbon ({\textgreater} 100 nm). The distribution of carbon in surface water was shifted to greater relative abundances of larger size fractions, suggesting a diagenetic sequence from macromolecular material to small refractory molecules. The average C:N ratios of particulate organic matter (POM) and HMW dissolved organic matter (DOM) were 7.7 and 16.7, respectively. Differences in C:N ratios between POM and HMW DOM were large and invariant with depth and geographic region, indicating that the aggregation of HMW DOM to form POM must be of minor significance to overall carbon dynamics. The stable carbon isotope composition (Œ¥13C) of POM averaged ‚àí22.7\%. in surface water and ‚àí25.2\%. in subsurface water. Several possible explanations for the observed isotopic shift with depth were explored, but we were unable to discern the cause. The Œ¥13C of HMW DOM samples was relatively constant and averaged ‚àí21.7\%., indicating a predominantly marine origin for this material. The Œ¥15N values of POM were highly variable (5.8‚Äì15.4\%.), and the availability of nitrate in surface waters appeared to be the major factor influencing Œ¥15N values in the equatorial Pacific. In the upwelling region nitrate concentrations were relatively high and Œ¥15N values of POM were low, whereas to the north and south of the upwelling nitrate concentrations were low and Œ¥15N values were high. The Œ¥15N values of HMW DOM reflected the same trends observed in the POM fraction and provided the first such evidence for biological cycling of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Using the observed Œ¥15N values and an estimate of meridional advection velocity, we estimated a turnover time of 0.3 to 0.5\% day‚àí1 for HMW DON. These results suggest a major role for DON in the upper ocean nitrogen cycle.},

	abstract = {Shallow lakes are hotspots for carbon processing and important natural sources of methane (CH4) emission. Ebullitive CH4 flux may constitute the overwhelming majority of total CH4 flux, but the episodic nature of ebullition events makes determining both quantity and the controlling factors challenging. Here we used the world's longest running shallow-lake mesocosm facility, where the experimental treatments are low and high nutrients crossed with three temperatures, to investigate the quantity and drivers of CH4 ebullition. The mean CH4 ebullition flux in the high nutrient treatment (41.5‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ52.3‚ÄØmg CH4‚ÄìC m‚àí2 d‚àí1) mesocosms was significantly larger than in the low nutrient treatment (3.6‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ5.4‚ÄØmg CH4‚ÄìC m‚àí2 d‚àí1) mesocosms, varying with temperature scenarios. Over eight weeks from June to August covered here warming resulted in a weak, but insignificant enhancement of CH4 ebullition. We found significant positive relationships between ebullition and chlorophyll-a, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), biodegradable DOC, Œ¥2H, Œ¥18O and Œ¥13C-DOC, autochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescent components, and a fraction of lipids, proteins, and lignins revealed using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, and a negative relationship between ebullitive CH4 flux and the percentage volume inhabited of macrophytes. A 24‚ÄØh laboratory bio-incubation experiment performed at room temperature (20‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ2‚ÄØ¬∞C) in the dark further revealed a rapid depletion of algal-DOM concurrent with a massive increased CH4 production, whereas soil-derived DOM had a limited effect on CH4 production. We conclude that eutrophication likely induced the loss of macrophytes and increase in algal biomass, and the resultant accumulation algal derived bio-labile DOM potentially drives enhanced outgassing of ebullitive CH4 from the shallow-lake mesocosms.},

Analyses using mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and nuclear (ITS) genes, as well as morphology, were conducted on a collection of Branchipolynoe from Pacific Costa Rican methane seeps and West Pacific hydrothermal vents. This revealed five new species of Branchipolynoe, and these are formally described. The new species from Costa Rica live in three species of Bathymodiolus mussels (also new) at depths ranging from 1000 to 1800 m. Branchipolynoe kajsae n. sp. and Branchipolynoe halliseyae n. sp. were found in all three undescribed Bathymodiolus species, while Branchipolynoe eliseae n. sp. was found in Bathymodiolus spp. 1 and 2, and Branchipolynoe meridae n. sp. was found in Bathymodiolus spp. 1 and 3. Hence, Bathymodiolus sp. 1 hosted all four of the new species, while the other two Bathymodiolus hosted three each. Most mussels contained only one specimen of Branchipolynoe; where there was more than one, these were often a female and smaller male of the same species. The newly discovered species from the West Pacific, Branchipolynoe tjiasmantoi n. sp., lives in unidentified Bathymodiolus at depths ranging from 674 to 2657 m from hydrothermal vents in the North Fiji (Fiji) and Lau Basins (Tonga) and also from New Zealand, Vanuatu, and the Manus Basin (Papua New Guinea). The phylogenetic and biogeographical implications of this diversity of Branchipolynoe are discussed.},

Sampling was performed at depths of 5 m (Angola Current; near-surface photic zone), 48 m (Angola Current; fluorescence maximum), 200 m (still above Antarctic Intermediate Water, AAIW; upper mesopelagic zone) and 5446 m (North Atlantic Deep Water, NADW; abyssopelagic, {\textasciitilde}30 m above seafloor) and produced SPE-DOM with near 40\% carbon yield and beneficial nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation properties, a crucial prerequisite for the acquisition of NMR spectra with excellent resolution. $^{\textrm{1}}$H and $^{\textrm{13}}$C NMR spectra of all four marine SPE-DOM showed smooth bulk envelopes, reflecting intrinsic averaging from massive signal overlap, with a few percent of visibly resolved signatures and variable abundances for all major chemical environments. The abundance of singly oxygenated aliphatics and acetate derivatives in $^{\textrm{1}}$H NMR spectra declined from surface to deep marine SPE-DOM, whereas C-based aliphatics and carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) increased in abundance. Surface SPE-DOM contained fewer methyl esters than all other samples, likely a consequence of direct exposure to sunlight. Integration of $^{\textrm{13}}$C NMR spectra revealed continual increase of carboxylic acids and ketones from surface to depth, reflecting a progressive oxygenation, with concomitant decline of carbohydrate-related substructures. Aliphatic branching increased with depth, whereas the fraction of oxygenated aliphatics declined for methine, methylene and methyl carbon. Lipids in the oldest SPE-DOM at 5446 m showed a larger share of ethyl groups and methylene carbon than observed in the other samples. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Two-dimensional NMR spectra showed exceptional resolution and depicted resolved molecular signatures in excess of a certain minimum abundance. Classical methyl groups terminating aliphatic chains represented {\textasciitilde}15\% of total methyl in all samples investigated. A noticeable fraction of methyl ({\textasciitilde}2\%) was bound to olefinic carbon. Methyl ethers were abundant in surface marine SPE-DOM, and the chemical diversity of carbohydrates was larger than that of freshwater and soil DOM. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} In all samples, we identified sp$^{\textrm{2}}$-hybridized carbon chemical environments with discrimination of isolated and conjugated olefins and \textit{Œ±},\textit{\&amp;beta;}-unsaturated double bonds. Olefinic proton and carbon atoms were more abundant than aromatic ones; olefinic unsaturation in marine SPE-DOM will be more directly traceable to ultimate biogenic precursors than aromatic unsaturation. The abundance of furan, pyrrol and thiophene derivatives was marginal, whereas benzene derivatives, phenols and six-membered nitrogen heterocycles were prominent; a yet unassigned set of six-membered N-heterocycles with likely more than one single nitrogen occurred in all samples. Various key polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon substructures suggested the presence of thermogenic organic matter at all water depths. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Progressive NMR cross-peak attenuation from surface to deep marine SPE-DOM was particularly strong in COSY NMR spectra and indicated a continual disappearance of biosignatures as well as entropy gain from an ever increased molecular diversity. Nevertheless, a specific near-seafloor SPE-DOM signature of unsaturated molecules recognized in both NMR and Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FTICR/MS) possibly originated from sediment leaching. The conformity of key NMR and FTICR/MS signatures suggested the presence of a large set of identical molecules throughout the entire ocean column even though the investigated water masses belonged to different oceanic regimes and currents. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} FTICR/MS showed abundant CHO, CHNO, CHOS and CHNOS molecular series with slightly increasing numbers of mass peaks and average mass from surface to bottom SPE-DOM.

While certain rather aliphatic CHOS and CHNOS ions were observed solely in the surface, deep marine SPE-DOM was enriched in unique unsaturated and rather oxygenated CHO and CHNO molecular series. With the exception of abyssopelagic SPE-DOM at 5446 m, which showed a peculiar CHOS chemistry of unsaturated carbon and reduced sulphur (black sulphur), CHO and CHNO molecular series contributed {\textasciitilde}87\% to total positive electrospray ionization FTICR mass peak integral, with a near constant ratio of CHNO / CHO molecular compositions near 1.13 ¬± 0.05.

	abstract = {Surface sediments (n=39) from the western Fram Strait and across the Yermak Plateau (Arctic Ocean) were investigated by molecular and isotopic organic geochemical methods to determine the composition, distribution and origin of extractable aliphatic lipids (n-alkanes, n-alkanols, fatty acids). Bulk geochemical parameters (TOC-content, Œ¥13Corg) were also determined, including additional samples nearby. Enhanced organic carbon contents of up to 1.6\% along the western slope of the Yermak Plateau and north off Spitsbergen, corroborated by an average Œ¥13Corg value of ‚àí22.3‚Ä∞, indicated most of the organic material to be of a marine origin, despite ice-cover. The extractable aliphatic lipids contributed up to 1\% of the sedimentary organic carbon and were dominated by fatty acids (0.7‚Äì9.1 mg/g TOC), whereas n-alkanes and n-alkanols contributed only minor amounts (0.1‚Äì0.4 mg/g TOC). The detailed molecular and carbon isotopic characterisation of the studied aliphatic compounds enabled assignments of most components to three lipid pools, representing: (a) primary production (marine phytoplankton, sea-ice algae), (b) secondary inputs (by feeding of zooplankton, benthic organisms and bacteria on the former) and (c) terrestrial-derived contributions. The first two compound groups dominated, but varied significantly in relation to the environment and were highest at the MIZ (Marginal Ice Zone), and along the permanently ice-covered western flank of the Yermak Plateau. In contrast, compounds attributable to a terrestrial source were of only minor importance in terms of absolute concentrations and less variable, but showed increasing relative proportions from an average of 8‚Äì14\% at and southwards of the MIZ up to 27‚Äì33\% on the Yermak Plateau and towards the central Arctic Ocean as a consequence of the weakening signal of primary and secondary production. This study provides further insights into the Arctic Ocean carbon dynamics, but also an example of the impact of ocean-currents on the deposition and composition of organic matter.},

In order to constrain those sources and processes, molecular variations of pore water DOM in surface sediments from the NW Iberian shelf were analyzed by ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and compared to river and marine water column DOM. Weighted average molecular element ratios of oxygen to carbon ((O/C)wa) and hydrogen to carbon ((H/C)wa) provided general information about DOM sources. DOM in local rivers was more oxygenated ((O/C)wa 0.52) and contained less hydrogen ((H/C)wa 1.15) than marine pore water DOM (mean (O/C)wa 0.50, mean (H/C)wa 1.26). The relative abundance of specific compound groups, such as highly oxygenated aromatic compounds or nitrogen-bearing compounds with low H/C ratios, correspond to a high concentration of lignin phenols (160Œºg/g sediment dry weight) and a high TOC/TN ratio (13.3) in the sedimentary organic matter and were therefore assigned to terrestrial sources. The lower degree of unsaturation and a higher relative abundance of nitrogen-bearing compounds in the pore water DOM reflected microbial activity within the sediment. One sampling site on the shelf with a high sediment accumulation, and a humic-rich river sample showed a wide range of sulfur compounds in the DOM, accompanied by a higher abundance of lipid biomarkers for sulfate-reducing bacteria, probably indicating early diagenetic sulfurization of organic matter.},

Methane-munching archaea in marine sediments live closely coupled to sulfate-reducing bacteria in a syntrophic relationship. Surprisingly, however, these archaea do not necessarily need their bacterial partners to survive or grow. Scheller et al. performed stable isotope incubation experiments with deep-sea methane seep sediments (see the Perspective by Rotaru and Thamdrup). Several groups of methane-oxidizing archaea could use a range of soluble electron acceptors instead of coupling to active bacterial sulfate reduction. This decoupled pathway shows that methane-oxidizing archaea transfer electrons extracellularly and may even possess the capacity to respire iron and manganese minerals that are abundant in seafloor sediments.
Science, this issue p. 703; see also p. 658
The oxidation of methane with sulfate is an important microbial metabolism in the global carbon cycle. In marine methane seeps, this process is mediated by consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) that live in syntrophy with sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). The underlying interdependencies within this uncultured symbiotic partnership are poorly understood. We used a combination of rate measurements and single-cell stable isotope probing to demonstrate that ANME in deep-sea sediments can be catabolically and anabolically decoupled from their syntrophic SRB partners using soluble artificial oxidants. The ANME still sustain high rates of methane oxidation in the absence of sulfate as the terminal oxidant, lending support to the hypothesis that interspecies extracellular electron transfer is the syntrophic mechanism for the anaerobic oxidation of methane.
Artificial electron acceptors metabolically decouple deep-sea methanotrophic archaea from their syntrophic partner bacteria. [Also see Perspective by Rotaru and Thamdrup]

However, recently it has been shown that some species of CCA inhibit this settlement. Moreover, it is largely unknown how the dissolved organic matter (DOM) exudates differ between CCA species and what bacterioplankton communities these exudates facilitate. We conducted single-day exudation experiments on two species of CCA, one which facilitates and one which inhibits coral larval settlement to contrast DOM production and this drives the microbial communities of both the tissue microbiome and bacterioplankton. We collected exudates from Hydrolithon reinboldii and Porolithon onkodes in both filter-sterilized seawater and unfiltered seawater. Our results demonstrate that both species produce equivalent quantities of dissolved organic carbon which differ in composition and facilitate distinct microbial communities. P. onkodes exudates facilitate more OTUs which are more correlated with coral disease, whereas H. reinboldii facilitated OTUs which have been shown to produce antimicrobial compounds. Our results begin to parse the differences in DOM exudation between CCA species and their potential to influence coral larval settlement.},

Heating within hydrothermal systems induces major molecular modifications of deep-sea DOM. Here, we tested the hypothesis that hydrothermal heating of deep-sea DOM enhances bioavailability. Aliquots of DOM extracted from the deep North Pacific (North Equatorial Pacific Intermediate Water; NEqPIW) were re-dissolved in artificial seawater and subjected to temperatures of 100 and 200‚ÄØ¬∞C (40‚ÄØMPa) using Dickson-type reactors. In agreement with earlier findings we observed a temperature-related drop in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (‚àí6.1\% at 100‚ÄØ¬∞C, ‚àí21.0\% at 200‚ÄØ¬∞C) that predominantly affected the solid-phase extractable (SPE-DOC) fraction (‚àí18.2\% at 100‚ÄØ¬∞C, ‚àí51.4\% at 200‚ÄØ¬∞C). Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometric (FT-ICR-MS) analysis confirmed a temperature-related reduction of average molecular mass, O/C ratios, double bond equivalents (DBE) and a relative increase in aromaticity (AImod). This thermally altered DOM was added (25‚ÄØŒºmol‚ÄØL‚àí1 DOC) to deep-water samples from the South West Pacific (Kermadec Arc, RV Sonne / SO253, 32¬∞ 37.706‚Ä≤ S {\textbar} 179¬∞ 38.728‚Ä≤ W) and incubated with the prevailing natural microbial community. After 16‚ÄØdays at 4‚ÄØ¬∞C in the dark, prokaryotic cell counts in incubations containing the full spectrum of thermally-degraded DOM (extractable and non-extractable compounds) had increased considerably (on average 21√ó for DOM100¬∞C and 27√ó for DOM200¬∞C). In contrast, prokaryotic growth in incubations to which only solid-phase extractable thermally-altered DOM was added was not enhanced compared to control incubations. The experiments demonstrate that temperature-driven degradation of deep-sea recalcitrant DOM within hydrothermal systems turns fractions of it accessible to microbes. The thermally-produced DOM compounds that stimulate microbial growth are not retained on reversed-phase resins (SPE-DOM) and are likely low-molecular mass organic acids. Despite the comprehensive compositional modifications of SPE-DOM (SPE-DOM) through heating, it remains inaccessible to microbes at the investigated concentration levels. The microbial incubation resulted in only minor and mostly insignificant overall changes in SPE-DOM molecular composition and concentration.},

The bioavailable fractions of DOC and DON (BDOC\% and BDON\%) varied substantially in different rivers and seasons, ranging respectively from 6 to 11\%, and 15‚Äì38\% during winter, and 0‚Äì6\% and 9‚Äì15\% during summer. Relatively higher BDOC\% and BDON\% occurred in the San Antonio and Aransas Rivers, which are impacted more by human activities through discharge from wastewater treatment plants. Seasonally, the riverine DOM was more bioavailable in winter than in summer when DOM may have been extensively degraded in situ due to the low base flow (or long residence time) and the elevated temperature in river water in summer. The principal component analysis on amino acid composition further confirmed that DOM was less degraded in winter than in summer. Functional gene abundance data revealed that winter riverine DOM was relatively labile as evidenced by an increase in N-metabolism pathways and functional genes during the winter incubation, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in summer. The findings of the varying bioavailability of DOM among rivers and seasons have important implications about the fate of riverine DOM and their potential contributions to nutrient supplies as southern Texas bays and estuaries are often nitrogen limited.},

However, the effect of acidification or carbonation on cellular metabolism in polar marine phytoplankton still remains an open question. There is some evidence that small chlorophytes may benefit more than other taxa of phytoplankton. To understand further how green polar picoplankton could acclimate to high oceanic CO2, studies were conducted on an Antarctic Chlorella sp. Chlorella sp. maintained its growth rate (‚àº0.180 d-1), photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm = ‚àº0.69) and chlorophyll a (0.145‚Äâfg cell-1) and carotenoid (0.06‚Äâfg cell-1) contents under high CO2, while maximum rates of electron transport decreased and non-photochemical quenching increased under elevated CO2. GCMS-based metabolomic analysis reveal that this polar Chlorella strain modulated the levels of metabolites associated with energy, amino acid, fatty acid and carbohydrate production, which could favour its survival in an increasingly acidified ocean.},

	abstract = {Decades of exploration for venting sites along spreading ridge crests have produced global datasets that yield estimated mean site spacings of ‚àº12‚Äì220 km. This conclusion demands that sites where hydrothermal Ô¨Çuid leaks from the seaÔ¨Çoor are improbably rare along the 66 000 km global ridge system, despite the high bulk permeability of ridge crest axes. However, to date, exploration methods have neither reliably detected plumes from isolated low-temperature, particle-poor, diffuse sources, nor differentiated individual, closely spaced (clustered within a few kilometers) sites of any kind. Here we describe a much lower mean discharge spacing of 3‚Äì20 km, revealed by towing real-time oxidation‚Äìreduction‚Äìpotential and optical sensors continuously along four fast- and intermediate-rate ({\textgreater}55 mm/yr) spreading ridge sections totaling 1470 km length. This closer spacing reÔ¨Çects both discovery of isolated sites discharging particle-poor plumes (25\% of all sites) and improved discrimination (at a spatial resolution of ‚àº1 km) among clustered discrete and diffuse sources. Consequently, the number of active vent sites on fastand intermediate-rate spreading ridges may be at least a factor of 3‚Äì6 higher than now presumed. This increase provides new quantitative constraints for models of seaÔ¨Çoor processes such as dispersal of fauna among seaÔ¨Çoor and crustal chemosynthetic habitats, biogeochemical impacts of diffuse venting, and spatial patterns of hydrothermal discharge.},

	abstract = {The Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean is the slowest spreading portion of the global midocean ridge system. Total spreading rates vary from 12.8 mm yr‚àí1 near Greenland to 6.5 mm yr‚àí1 at the Siberian margin. Melting models predict a dramatic decrease in magma production and resulting crustal thickness at these low spreading rates. At slow spreading ridges, small volcanic seamounts are a dominant morphologic feature of the rift valley Ô¨Çoor and an important mechanism in building the oceanic crust. This study quantitatively investigates the extent, nature and distribution of seamount volcanism at the ultraslow Gakkel Ridge, the manner in which it varies along the ridge axis and the relationship of the volcanoes to the larger scale rift morphology. A numerical algorithm is used to identify and characterize isolated volcanic ediÔ¨Åces by searching gridded swath-bathymetry data for closed concentric contours protruding above the surrounding seaÔ¨Çoor. A maximum likelihood model is used to estimate the total number of seamounts and the characteristic height within different seamount populations. Both the number and size of constructional volcanic features is greatly reduced at the Gakkel Ridge compared with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). The density of seamounts (number/area) on the rift valley Ô¨Çoor of the Western Volcanic Zone (WVZ) is ‚àº55\% that of the MAR. The observed volcanoes are also much smaller, so, the amount of erupted material is greatly reduced compared with the MAR. However, the WVZ is still able to maintain a MAR-like morphology with axial volcanic ridges, volcanoes scattered on the valley Ô¨Çoor and rift valley walls consisting of high-angle faults. Seamount density at the Eastern Volcanic Zone (EVZ) is ‚àº45\% that of the WVZ (‚àº25\% that of the MAR). Seamounts are clustered at the widely spaced magmatic centres characteristic of the EVZ, although some seamounts are found between magmatic centres. These seamounts tend to be located at the edge of the rift valley or on the valley walls rather than on the valley Ô¨Çoor. Seamounts in the Sparsely Magmatic Zone (SMZ) are located almost entirely at the 19‚ó¶E magmatic centre with none observed within a 185 km-long portion of the rift valley Ô¨Çoor. The EVZ and SMZ appear to display a mode of crustal accretion, characterized by extreme focusing of melt to the magmatic centres. Magmas erupted between the magmatic centres appear to have ascended along faults. This is very different from what is observed at the WVZ (or the MAR), and there is a threshold transition between the two modes of crustal accretion. At the Gakkel Ridge, the location of the transition appears to be localized by a boundary in mantle composition.},

Models show that full spreading rates vary between 1.3 and 0.63 mm yr‚àí1 along the almost 1800 km long ridge system in the Central Arctic Ocean. The western part of the ridge was investigated in great detail by a two-ship expedition in summer 2001. The complete data sets and the modelling of the seismic refraction and aeromagnetic experiments gathered during this expedition are shown in this study. The magnetic signals along the dense (2 km spacing) aeromagnetic Ô¨Çight lines acquired at the same time show a good correlation between high amplitudes and a shallowing of the rift valley and the presence of large volcanic constructions at the rift shoulders. The magnetic anomalies rapidly fade out east and west of these centres of focused magmatism. This might indicate that the basaltic layer producing the magnetic anomaly thins away from the volcanic centres. A continuous magnetic anomaly is observed along the rift valley west of 3‚ó¶30 E, consistent with increasing and more robust magmatism.},

	abstract = {Never before has a volcanic eruption on a slow- or ultraslowspreading mid-ocean ridge been both observed seismically and conÔ¨Årmed on the seaÔ¨Çoor. During the Ô¨Årst half of 1999, a long-lived volcanic-spreading event occurred on the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean. The seismicity associated with this event was unprecedented in duration and magnitude for a seaÔ¨Çoor eruption. Sonar images from the U.S.S. Hawkbill, which passed over the area within four months of the start of activity, are consistent with the presence of a large, recently erupted Ô¨Çow and a volcanic peak directly in the area of seismic activity. Seismic activity began in mid-January and continued vigorously for three months; a reduced rate of activity persisted for an additional four months or more. In total, 252 events were large enough to be recorded on global seismic networks. Although a limited number of volcanic-spreading events have been observed globally, the duration and magnitude of the Gakkel Ridge swarm, when compared with volcanic seismicity at ridges spreading at intermediate and fast spreading rates, suggest that a negative power-law relationship may exist between these parameters and spreading rate. Fault activation, in response to magmatic emplacement, appears to have occurred over a broad region, suggesting that magma may have been tapped from mantle depths. The slow migration of the largest magnitude events along the axis of the rift valley suggests multiple magmatic pulses at depth. In combination with bathymetric setting and sidescan sonar conÔ¨Årmation, the seismic data for this event have provided a unique look at the scale and character of eruption processes at ultraslow-spreading rates.},

DFAAs were not detected (‚â§ 1 nM) in the hot vent fluids, a result which probably reflects the instability of these compounds when exposed to the extreme high temperatures and pressures characteristic of hydrothermal fluids. Ammonium is the principal end-product of this thermal catalytic diagenesis. Hydrothermal vent and non-vent control sediments had DFAA concentrations ranging from 5‚àí445 and 10‚Äì28 ŒºM, respectively. The DFAA concentrations in both habitats were highest in the near-surface region (0‚Äì4 cm) and decreased at greater depths. The depth-dependent concentration gradients for hydrothermally impacted sediments were steeper than for the control samples and covaried with total microbial biomass. The molecular composition of the hydrothermally impacted samples included most common protein amino acids in addition to Œ≤-aminoglutaric acid. Glutamate, glycine, serine, and alanine were major constituents of the DFAA pool.},

	abstract = {The global ocean sequesters a large amount of reduced carbon in dissolved organic molecules that can persist for centuries to millennia. The persistence of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the deep ocean has been attributed to inherently refractory molecules and to low concentrations of molecules, but the relative roles of molecular properties and molecular concentrations remain uncertain. We investigate both of these possibilities using bioassay experiments with unfiltered seawater collected from five depths (50‚Äì1500 m) at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study site. The microbial utilization of compositionally distinct forms of seawater DOC at in situ and elevated concentrations was determined. Microbial utilization of in situ organic carbon ranged from 6\% to 7\% in surface waters to 0\% in deep water after 180 d. Additions of surface plankton-derived DOC ( 18 Œºmol L‚àí1), which was enriched in amino acids and carbohydrates, revealed substantial (50‚Äì75\%) removal of the added DOC at all depths within 7 d. In sharp contrast, additions of C-18 isolated deep-sea DOC ( 20 Œºmol L‚àí1) showed insignificant or minimal utilization at all depths after 7 or 180 d, even when primed with labile substrates. These experiments demonstrate microbial communities from varying depths and environments in the ocean could rapidly utilize elevated concentrations of plankton-derived DOC, whereas these same microbes failed to utilize elevated concentrations of C-18 DOC. These results indicate molecular properties are the primary control on the microbial utilization of DOC in the ocean. Our findings imply a dynamic DOC reservoir with a flexible capacity for carbon sequestration in the global ocean.},

It is likely that vents were present in the oceans of the primitive Earth because the process of hydrothermal circulation probably began early in the Earth's history2. Here we examine the popular hypothesis3-7 that life arose in these vents. This proposal, however, is based on a number of misunderstandings concerning the organic chemistry involved. An example is the suggestion that organic compounds were destroyed on the surface of the early Earth by the impact of asteroids and comets, but at the same time assuming that organic syntheses can occur in hydrothermal vents7. The high temperatures in the vents would not allow synthesis of organic compounds, but would decompose them, unless the exposure time at vent temperatures was short8-11. Even if the essential organic molecules were available in the hot hydrothermal waters, the subsequent steps of polymerization and the conversion of these polymers into the first organisms would not occur as the vent waters were quenched to the colder temperatures of the primitive oceans. ¬© 1988 Nature Publishing Group.},

Then, as now, they encompassed a multiplicity of physical and chemical gradients as a direct result of interactions between extensive hydrothermal activity in the Earth's crust and the overlying oceanic and atmospheric environments. We have proposed that these gradients provided the necessary multiple pathways for the abiotic synthesis of chemical compounds, origin and evolution of ‚Äòprecells‚Äô and ‚Äòprecell‚Äô communities and, ultimately, the evolution of free-living organisms. This hypothesis is consistent with the tectonic, paleontological, and degassing history of the earth and with the use of thermal energy sources in the laboratory to synthesize amino acids and complex organic compounds. In this paper, we expand upon the geophysical, chemical, and possible microbiological analogies between contemporary and Archean hydrothermal systems and suggest several hypotheses, related to our model for the origin and evolution of life at Archean vents, which can be tested in present-day hydrothermal systems.},

	abstract = {Hydrocarbon vents have recently been reported to contribute considerable amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to the oceans. Many such hydrocarbon vents widely exist in the northern South China Sea (NSCS). To investigate if these hydrocarbon vent sites release DOC, we used a real-time video multiple-corer to collect bottom seawater and surface sediments at vent sites. We analyzed concentrations of DOC in these samples and estimated DOC fluxes. Elevated DOC concentrations in the porewaters were found at some sites suggesting that DOC may come from these hydrocarbon vents. Benthic fluxes of DOC from these sediments were 28 to 1264 Œºmol m‚àí2 d‚àí1 (on average {\textasciitilde}321 Œºmol m‚àí2 d‚àí1) which are several times higher than most DOC fluxes in coastal and continental margin sediments. The results demonstrate that the real-time video multiple-corer can precisely collect samples at vent sites. The estimated benthic DOC flux from the methane venting sites (8.6 √ó 106 mol y‚àí1), is 24\% of the DOC discharge from the Pearl River to the South China Sea, indicating that these sediments make an important contribution to the DOC in deep waters.},

We therefore want to take this opportunity to illustrate the diversity, functionality, and sheer survivability of these ancient animals. Beyond its multitude of external shapes and colors, sponges hold a unique internal aquiferous system. This system of afferent and efferent canals is intricately linked to supply its key function as a filter feeder. By filtering both particulate and dissolved material, sponges fill a niche in nutrient cycling. Moreover, the survivability of sponges is demonstrated in the variety of habitats it resides in; from freshwater canals to polar deep seas. In formerly uninhabitable environments, sponges can potentially create biodiversity hotspots by providing habitat complexity and shelter from predators. This review will give insight into the early life history, morphology, diet, and reproduction of sponges. Furthermore, it is imperative to consider their function as habitat facilitator, nutrient cycler, and, last but not the least, their potential for future pharmaceuticals. The emphasis in the proceedings has been specifically put on the role of sponges as nutrient cycler as they play a role in the three essential elements: carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous. With all this in mind, it should be clear that even though sponges are relatively overlooked marine invertebrates, they should be studied similarly to corals and respected as a key ecosystem driver in novel and established environments.},

	abstract = {The paradigm of large geographic ranges in the deep sea has been challenged by genetic studies, which often reveal putatively widespread species to be several taxa with more restricted ranges. Recently, a phylogeographic study revealed that the tubeworm Sclerolinum contortum (Siboglinidae) inhabits vents and seeps from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Here, we further test the conspecificity of the same populations of S. contortum with additional mitochondrial and nuclear markers. We also investigate the genetic connectivity of another species with putatively the same wide geographic range - Nicomache lokii (Maldanidae). Our results support the present range of S. contortum, and the range of N. lokii is extended from vents and seeps in the Nordic Seas to mud volcanoes in the Barbados Trench and Antarctic vents. Sclerolinum contortum shows more pronounced geographic structure than N. lokii, but whether this is due to different dispersal capacities or reflects the geographic isolation of the sampled localities is unclear. Two distinct mitochondrial lineages of N. lokii are present in the Antarctic, which may result from two independent colonization events. The environmental conditions inhabited by the two species and implications for their distinct habitat preference is discussed.},

	abstract = {The H√•kon Mosby mud volcano (the Norwegian Sea, depth c. 1250 m) was studied in July 1998 by a joint Russian‚ÄìGerman‚ÄìUSA‚ÄìNorwegian expedition on the 40th cruise of the RV Akademik Mstislav Keldysh using the two Mir submersibles. The benthic community is dominated by two species of symbiotrophic pogonophores, Sclerolinum contortum (more abundant) and Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis. The biomass of S. contortum reaches at least 435 g m ; for O. haakonmosbiensis the value is 350 g m . Different benthic organisms form associations with each species of pogonophore. The total list of known benthic fauna includes 46 species. A zoarcid fish, Lycodes squamiventer, is a common member of the benthic community. Bacterial mats are found over an extensive part of the crater. The background benthic community is much poorer and is dominated by ophiuroids (Ophiocten gracilis, Ophiopleura borealis). Pycnogonids (Collossendeis proboscidea), buccinid gastropods and asteroids are also present. Stable carbon isotope data showed significant depletion of C in both species of pogonophores: in S. contortum Œ¥ C was up to ‚àí48.3‚Ä∞, in O. haakonmosbiensis the value varied from ‚àí51.1 to ‚àí56.1‚Ä∞. It can be suggested that the methane carbon contributes to the nutrition of the pogonophoran O. haakonmosbisensis. Carbon isotopes also revealed incorporation of non‚Äêphotosynthetic carbon into local trophic webs: Œ¥ C in Metacaprella horrida (amphipod) showed ‚àí44.9‚Ä∞, in the tube‚Äêdwelling polychaete (Amphinomidae) ‚àí40.6‚Ä∞.

The observed changes are mainly due to an increased abundance of opportunistic species, especially of the polychaete Polydora sp. during the last 10‚Äì15‚ÄØyears which is correlated significantly to declining dissolved oxygen, rising temperature in the bottom water and increasing total organic matter in the sediment.

	abstract = {As shown by recent studies, filter-feeding sponges are known to host a wide variety of microorganisms. However, the microbial community of the non-filtering carnivorous sponges (Porifera, Cladorhizidae) has been the subject of less scrutiny. Here, we present the results from a comparative study of the methanotrophic carnivorous sponge Cladorhiza methanophila from a mud volcano-rich area at the Barbados Accretionary Prism (BAP), and five carnivorous species from the Jan Mayen Vent Field (JMVF) at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge. Results from 16S rRNA microbiome data indicate the presence of a diverse assemblage of associated microorganisms in carnivorous sponges mainly from the Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriaceae and Thaumarchaeota. While the abundance of particular groups varied throughout the dataset, we found interesting similarities to previous microbiome results from non-carnivorous deep sea sponges, suggesting that the carnivorous sponges share characteristics of a previously hypothesized putative deep-sea sponge microbial community. Chemolithoautotrophic symbiosis was confirmed for C. methanophila through a microbial community with a high abundance of Methylococcales and very light isotopic Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N ratios (-60 to -66‚Ä∞/3.5 to 5.2‚Ä∞) compared to the other cladorhizid species (-22 to -24‚Ä∞/8.5-10.5‚Ä∞). We provide evidence for the presence of putative sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria in the arctic cladorhizids; however, Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N signatures did not provide evidence for significant chemoautotrophic symbiosis in this case, and the slightly higher abundance of cladorhizids at the JMVF site compared to the nearby deep sea likely stem from an increased abundance of prey rather than a more direct vent association. The phylogenetic position of C. methanophila in relation to other carnivorous sponges was established using a three-gene phylogenetic analysis, and it was found to be closely related to other non-methanotrophic Cladorhiza species with a similar morphology included in the dataset, suggesting a recent origin for methanotrophy in this species. C. methanophila remains the only known carnivorous sponge with a strong, chemolithoautotrophic symbiont association, and methanotrophic symbiosis does not seem to be a widespread property within the Cladorhizidae.},

	abstract = {Oceanic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an important carbon pool, similar in magnitude to atmospheric CO2, but the fate of its oldest forms is not well understood1,2. Hot hydrothermal circulation may facilitate the degradation of otherwise un-reactive dissolved organic matter, playing an important role in the long-term global carbon cycle. The oldest, most recalcitrant forms of DOC, which make up most of oceanic DOC, can be recovered by solid-phase extraction. Here we present measurements of solid-phase extractable DOC from samples collected between 2009 and 2013 at seven vent sites in the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern oceans, along with magnesium concentrations, a conservative tracer of water circulation through hydrothermal systems. We find that magnesium and solid-phase extractable DOC concentrations are correlated, suggesting that solid-phase extractable DOC is almost entirely lost from solution through mineralization or deposition during circulation through hydrothermal vents with fluid temperatures of 212‚Äì401 ¬∞C. In laboratory experiments, where we heated samples to 380 ¬∞C for four days, we found a similar removal efficiency. We conclude that thermal degradation alone can account for the loss of solid-phase extractable DOC in natural hydrothermal systems, and that its maximum lifetime is constrained by the timescale of hydrothermal cycling, at about 40 million years3.},

In natural high-temperature hydrothermal systems, DOM is almost completely removed, but the mechanism and temperature dependence of this removal have not been studied to date. We investigated molecular-level changes to DOM that was solid-phase extracted (SPE-DOM) from the deep ocean of the North Pacific Ocean. This complex molecular mixture was experimentally exposed to temperatures between 100 and 380¬∞C over the course of two weeks in artificial seawater, and was then characterised on a molecular level via ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Almost 93\% of SPE-DOM was removed by the treatment at 380¬∞C, and this removal was accompanied by a consistent pattern of SPE-DOM alteration across the temperatures studied. Higher molecular weight and more oxygen rich compounds were preferentially removed, suggesting that decarboxylation and dehydration of carboxylic acid and alcohol groups are the most rapid degradation mechanisms. Nitrogen containing compounds followed the same overall trends as those containing just C, H and O up to 300¬∞C. Above this temperature, the most highly altered samples contained very little of the original character of marine DOM, instead being mainly composed of very low intensity N- and S- containing molecules with a high H/C ratio ({\textgreater}1.5). Our results suggest that abiotic hydrothermal alteration of SPE-DOM may already occur at temperatures above 68¬∞C. Our experiments were conducted without a sedimentary or mineral phase, and demonstrate that profound molecular alteration and almost complete removal of marine SPE-DOM requires nothing more than heating in a seawater matrix.},

	abstract = {Cold-seep environments and their associated symbiont-bearing megafaunal communities create islands of primary production for macro- and meiofauna in the otherwise monotonous and nutrient-poor deep-sea environment. To examine the spatial variation and distribution patterns of metazoan meiobenthos in different seepage-related habitats, samples were collected in two regions off Norway: several pockmarks associated with the Storegga Slide including the Nyegga pockmark area (730m; 64¬∞N), and the active, methane-venting H√•kon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV) west of the Barents Sea (1280m; 72¬∞N). Based on sediment geochemistry and associated epifauna, three different habitat types were distinguished across the two regions: (1) reduced sediment with suboxic conditions, sometimes covered by bacterial mats, (2) sediment colonised by chemosynthetic, siboglinid tubeworms, and (3) sediment outside the influence of seepage and without a large chemosynthetic fauna. Meiofaunal communities varied strongly in terms of generic diversity and dominance among the different habitat types. Control sites and Siboglinidae polychaete fields both supported high nematode genus richness similar to normal deep-sea sediments, whereas the reduced sediments yielded a genus-poor nematode community dominated by one or two successful species. Meiofaunal densities in the different habitats were negatively correlated with macrobenthic densities. An extremely dense ({\textgreater}11,000ind.10cm‚Äì2), mono-specific nematode population appeared to be restricted to the bacterial mats at HMMV. It consisted of a new cryptic species of the Halomonhystera disjuncta complex, which has been described from intertidal habitats in the North Sea. The reduced seep sediments at Nyegga did not yield H. disjuncta but were dominated by Terschellingia longicaudata, another cosmopolitan nematode species known to be abundant in organic-rich, oxygen-poor, shallow-water environments. These observations point to a past or recent connection between margins and shallow-water habitats.},

	abstract = {Submarine hydrothermal venting has recently been identified to have the potential to impact ocean biogeochemistry at the global scale. This is the case because processes active in hydrothermal plumes are so vigorous that the residence time of the ocean, with respect to cycling through hydrothermal plumes, is comparable to that of deep ocean mixing caused by thermohaline circulation. Recently, it has been argued that seafloor venting may provide a significant source of bio-essential Fe to the oceans as the result of a close coupling between Fe and organic carbon in hydrothermal plumes. But a complementary question remains to be addressed: does this same intimate Fe‚ÄìCorg association in hydrothermal plumes cause any related impact to the global C cycle? To address this, SCOR-InterRidge Working Group 135 developed a modeling approach to synthesize site-specific field data from the East Pacific Rise 9¬∞50‚Ä≤ N hydrothermal field, where the range of requisite data sets is most complete, and combine those inputs with global estimates for dissolved Fe inputs from venting to the oceans to establish a coherent model with which to investigate hydrothermal Corg cycling. The results place new constraints on submarine Fe vent fluxes worldwide, including an indication that the majority of Fe supplied to hydrothermal plumes should come from entrainment of diffuse flow. While this same entrainment is not predicted to enhance the supply of dissolved organic carbon to hydrothermal plumes by more than ‚àº10\% over background values, what the model does indicate is that scavenging of carbon in association with Fe-rich hydrothermal plume particles should play a significant role in the delivery of particulate organic carbon to deep ocean sediments, worldwide.},

The mounds form primarily by deposition of Fe, Mn and Si from hydrothermal fluids which circulate through the basalt crust and the overlying sediments.

The nontronite is exceptionally well crystallized, and contains less than 200 ppm Al. The Mn minerals, todorokite and birnessite, also have exceptional crystallinity and the distribution of trace elements Cu, Ni, Zn, Co, Ca and Ba in these phases agrees with predictions made on the basis of models of their crystal structure.

	abstract = {The geographic remoteness of the ultraslow Gakkel Ridge in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean raises many questions about the nature and biogeography of its habitats. In 2001, the two-ice-breaker mission AMORE (RV POLARSTERN and USCGC HEALY) detected hydrothermal plumes and evidence for seafloor venting associated with volcanic ridges rising from the rift valley floor of 4.2 km depth (Edmonds et al., 2003; Michael et al., 2003). The AURORA expedition in July 2014 (RV POLARSTERN Cruise PS86) targeted this "Aurora" field at the SW limit of Gakkel Ridge, to investigate its habitats, communities and their energy sources. No robots can yet be deployed through ice-cover to explore such deep habitats and ice-breaking research vessels cannot hold position in the thick multiyear ice. Instead, we estimated ice-drift to predict suitable start positions, then attached POLARSTERN to a matching ice floe, to achieve the bottom trajectories that we required for targeted exploration. The Aurora mount is volcanic in origin formed from mounded pillow basalts overlain by about a meter of sediment and cut through by steep cliffs revealing basalt pillows in outcrop and in talus piles. We identified persistent plume activity in the water column above the mount at 3100-3600 m (800-300 m off-bottom of its top) characterized by anomalies in turbidity, Eh, methane, temperature, density, and elevated microbial chemoautotrophic activity. Using a towed camera-, and multisensor- platform (OFOS) we located active venting as the source of this plume together with inactive chimneys and associated craters on the SW flank of Mt.Aurora. Its dominantly filter-feeding fauna is apparently sustained by venting of energy-rich fluids and microbial transfer of this geofuel into nutrition. This communication presents first results of our recent fieldwork and experimental investigations in Summer 2014 to explore deep-sea ecosystems in ice-covered oceans. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The ChEss project of the Census of Marine Life (2002‚Äì2010) helped foster internationally-coordinated studies worldwide focusing on exploration for, and characterization of new deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystem sites. This work has advanced our understanding of the nature and factors controlling the biogeography and biodiversity of these ecosystems in four geographic locations: the Atlantic Equatorial Belt (AEB), the New Zealand region, the Arctic and Antarctic and the SE Pacific off Chile. In the AEB, major discoveries include hydrothermal seeps on the Costa Rica margin, deepest vents found on the Mid-Cayman Rise and the hottest vents found on the Southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It was also shown that the major fracture zones on the MAR do not create barriers for the dispersal but may act as trans-Atlantic conduits for larvae. In New Zealand, investigations of a newly found large cold-seep area suggest that this region may be a new biogeographic province. In the Arctic, the newly discovered sites on the Mohns Ridge (71¬∞N) showed extensive mats of sulfur-oxidisng bacteria, but only one gastropod potentially bears chemosynthetic symbionts, while cold seeps on the Haakon Mossby Mud Volcano (72¬∞N) are dominated by siboglinid worms. In the Antarctic region, the first hydrothermal vents south of the Polar Front were located and biological results indicate that they may represent a new biogeographic province. The recent exploration of the South Pacific region has provided evidence for a sediment hosted hydrothermal source near a methane-rich cold-seep area. Based on our 8 years of investigations of deep-water chemosynthetic ecosystems worldwide, we suggest highest priorities for future research: (i) continued exploration of the deep-ocean ridge-crest; (ii) increased focus on anthropogenic impacts; (iii) concerted effort to coordinate a major investigation of the deep South Pacific Ocean ‚Äì the largest contiguous habitat for life within Earth's biosphere, but also the world's least investigated deep-ocean basin.},

Yet, we know very little about the temperature sensitivity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) degradation in a warming ocean. Combining independent estimates from laboratory experiments, oceanographic cruises and a global ocean DOC cycling model, we assess the relationship between DOC decay constants and seawater temperatures. Our results show that the apparent activation energy of DOC decay (Ea) increases by 3-fold from the labile (lifetime of days) and semi-labile (lifetime of months) to the semi-refractory (lifetime of decades) DOC pools, with only minor differences between the world‚Äôs largest ocean basins. This translates into increasing temperature coefficients (Q10) from 1.7‚Äì1.8 to 4‚Äì8, showing that the generalised assumption of a constant Q10 of {\textasciitilde}2 for biological rates is not universally applicable for the microbial degradation of DOC in the ocean. Therefore, rising ocean temperatures will preferentially impact the microbial degradation of the more recalcitrant and larger of the three studied pools. Assuming a uniform 1¬∫C warming scenario throughout the ocean, our model predicts a global decrease of the DOC reservoir by 7 ¬± 1 Pg C. This represents a 15\% reduction of the semi-labile + semi-refractory DOC pools.},

This review provides the first comprehensive overview of the use and capabilities of MS within environmental metabolomics. Its primary aims are to introduce environmental scientists to the range of MS approaches used in metabolomics and to highlight the breadth and diversity of environmental and ecological research conducted, from ecophysiology and ecotoxicology to chemical ecology. The review is structured around MS approaches: non-targeted gas chromatography‚ÄìMS, non-targeted directed infusion MS, and both non-targeted and targeted liquid chromatography‚ÄìMS. Each section begins with a brief introduction to the analytical method, including some advantages and limitations in the context of metabolomics research, and then exemplifies the use of that technique in environmental metabolomics. The review concludes with a discussion on some of the challenges that remain in MS based environmental metabolomics and provides recommendations for the path ahead.},

            This paper investigates the relationship between apparent size distribution and molecular complexity of dissolved organic matter from the natural environment. We used a high pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) method coupled to UV-Vis diode array detection (UV-DAD) and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in order to compare the apparent size of natural organic matter, determined by HPSEC-UV and the molecular mass determined online by ESI-MS. We found that there was a clear discrepancy between the two methods, and found evidence for an important pool of organic matter that has a strong UV absorbance and no ESI-MS signal. Contrary to some previous research, we found no evidence that apparently high molecular weight organic matter is constituted by aggregates of low molecular weight ({\textless}1000 Da) material. Furthermore, our results suggest that the majority of apparent size variability within the ESI ionisable pool of organic matter is due to secondary interaction and exclusion effects on the HPSEC column, and not true differences in hydrodynamic size or intermolecular aggregation.},

This long-term accumulation of carbon may be facilitated by abiotic and biotic production of chemical structures that resist degradation, consequently contributing disproportionately to refractory DOM. Compounds that are selectively preserved in seawater were identified in solid-phase extracted DOM (PPL-DOM) using comprehensive gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). These molecules contained cyclic head groups that were linked to isoprenoid tails, and their overall structures closely resembled carotenoid degradation products (CDP). The origin of these compounds in PPL-DOM was further confirmed with an in vitro Œ≤-carotene photooxidation experiment that generated water-soluble CDP with similar structural characteristics. The molecular-level identification linked at least 10\% of PPL-DOM carbon, and thus 4\% of total DOM carbon, to CDP. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of experimental CDP and environmental PPL-DOM overlapped considerably, which indicated that even a greater proportion of PPL-DOM was likely composed of CDP. The CDP-rich DOM fraction was depleted in radiocarbon (14C age {\textgreater} 1500 years), a finding that supports the possible long-term accumulation of CDP in seawater. By linking a specific class of widespread biochemicals to refractory DOM, this work provides a foundation for future studies that aim to examine how persistent DOM forms in the ocean.},

Here, we evaluate an untargeted approach to detect qualitative and relative-quantitative variations in LMW DOM with depth using water extracts from a soil core from the Alaskan Arctic, a unique system that contains nearly half the Earth‚Äôs terrestrial carbon and is rapidly warming due to climate change. We combined reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, and nano-electrospray ionization coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry in positive- and negative-ionization mode. The optimized conditions were sensitive, robust, highly complementary, and enabled detection and putative annotations of a wide range of compounds (e.g. amino acids, plant/microbial metabolites, sugars, lipids, peptides). Furthermore, multivariate statistical analyses revealed subtle but consistent and significant variations with depth. Thus, this platform is useful not only for characterizing LMW DOM, but also for quantifying relative variations in LMW DOM availability across space, revealing hotspots of biogeochemical activity for further evaluation.},

However, it remains enigmatic to what extent these chemolithoautotrophic archaea release dissolved organic carbon (DOC). A combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomics was used to characterize the exometabolomes of three model AOA strains of the Nitrosopumilus genus. Our results indicate that marine AOA exude a suite of organic compounds with potentially varying reactivities, dominated by nitrogen-containing compounds. A significant fraction of the released dissolved organic matter (DOM) consists of labile compounds, which typically limit prokaryotic heterotrophic activity in open ocean waters, including amino acids, thymidine and B vitamins. Amino acid release rates corresponded with ammonia oxidation activity and the three Nitrosopumilus strains predominantly released hydrophobic amino acids, potentially as a result of passive diffusion. Despite the low contribution of DOC released by AOA ( 0.08\%‚Äì1.05\%) to the heterotrophic prokaryotic carbon demand, the release of physiologically relevant metabolites could be crucial for microbes that are auxotrophic for some of these compounds, including members of the globally abundant and ubiquitous SAR11 clade.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Chlorophyll concentrations of biological soil crust (biocrust) samples are
commonly determined to quantify the relevance of photosynthetically active
organisms within these surface soil communities. Whereas chlorophyll
extraction methods for freshwater algae and leaf tissues of vascular plants
are well established, there is still some uncertainty regarding the optimal
extraction method for biocrusts, where organism composition is highly
variable and samples comprise major amounts of soil. In this study we
analyzed the efficiency of two different chlorophyll extraction solvents, the
effect of grinding the soil samples prior to the extraction procedure, and
the impact of shaking as an intermediate step during extraction. The analyses
were conducted on four different types of biocrusts. Our results show that
for all biocrust types chlorophyll contents obtained with ethanol were
significantly lower than those obtained using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a
solvent. Grinding of biocrust samples prior to analysis caused a highly
significant decrease in chlorophyll content for green algal lichen- and
cyanolichen-dominated biocrusts, and a tendency towards lower values for
moss- and algae-dominated biocrusts. Shaking of the samples after each
extraction step had a significant positive effect on the chlorophyll content
of green algal lichen- and cyanolichen-dominated biocrusts. Based on our
results we confirm a DMSO-based chlorophyll extraction method without
grinding pretreatment and suggest the addition of an intermediate shaking
step for complete chlorophyll extraction (see Supplement¬†S6 for detailed
manual). Determination of a universal chlorophyll extraction method for
biocrusts is essential for the inter-comparability of publications conducted
across all continents.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils enters the aquatic environment via headwater streams. Thereafter, it is gradually transformed, removed by sedimentation, and mineralised. Due to the proximity to the terrestrial source and short water residence time, the extent of transformation is minimal in headwaters. DOM has variable composition across inland waters, but the amount of variability in the terrestrial end member is unknown. This gap in knowledge is crucial considering the potential impact large variability would have on modelling DOM degradation. Here, we used a novel liquid chromatography ‚Äìmass spectrometry method to characterise DOM in 74 randomly selected, forested headwater streams in an 87,000 km2 region of southeast Sweden. We found a large degree of sample similarity across this region, with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity values averaging 8.4‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.0\% (mean‚Äâ¬±‚ÄâSD). The identified variability could be reduced to two principle coordinates, correlating to varying groundwater flow-paths and regional mean temperature. Our results indicate that despite reproducible effects of groundwater geochemistry and climate, the composition of DOM is remarkably similar across catchments already as it leaves the terrestrial environment, rather than becoming homogeneous as different headwaters and sub-catchments mix.},

Evidence for the existence of gas hydrates both inside and outside the Storegga Slide complex comes from reflection seismic profiles, where a bottom-simulating reflection marks today's base of the gas hydrate stability zone. Paleo-bottom water temperatures show a relatively fast increase at approximately 12.5‚Äì10ka (calendar years) following the Younger Dryas while stable warm water conditions have prevailed since then. Despite sea level rise, this warm-water inflow caused a major reduction in the thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone along the upper slope of the mid-Norwegian margin. Modelling results indicate that critical hydrate stability conditions and consequently the maximal potential pore pressure build-up occur at the location of the Storegga Slide headwall. Although the major phase of hydrate melting predates the Storegga slide event, dated at 8.2ka (calendar years), reduced hydrate stability conditions could have facilitated or contributed to sub-marine slope failure. Additionally, the bottom-simulating reflections within the slide complex seem to have nearly adjusted to new equilibrium conditions, highlighting the dynamics of hydrate stability in continental margin sediments under environmental changes (climate change, geohazards).},

	abstract = {The Bergen Ocean Model (BOM), a three-dimensional sigma-layered numerical ocean model, is used to simulate the circulation in Storfjorden with the sounds Heleysundet and Freemansundet opened. Two simulations forced by four tidal constituents are carried out; one where the wind forcing is from the high resolution, non-hydrostatic atmospheric model MM5, and one where the wind forcing is from the coarse resolution NCEP reanalyzed fields. Through comparison of the two wind fields, it becomes clear that a high resolution wind is necessary to resolve the topographic influence on the wind field over the Svalbard Archipelago. The stronger and more variable fine-scale MM5 wind includes more events with high wind speeds than the NCEP reanalyzed field and is required to reproduce realistic currents in Storfjorden. Due to the surface Ekman transport, easterly winds seem to favor a cyclonic surface current, whereas southerly and westerly winds tend to stop it. The mean easterly wind flow over the Svalbard Archipelago is represented in both wind fields, but the mean cyclonic circulation in Storfjorden is only reproduced with fine-scale wind forcing. The residual currents through Heleysundet and Freemansundet compensate for the Ekman transport and the accompanying surface elevation difference along the sounds during different wind directions. The modelled tidal currents up to 1.5 and 1.7ms-1 in Heleysundet and Freemansundet, respectively, are controlled by the 200‚àò‚Äì220‚àò phase shift of the tidal wave in Storfjorden and northwestern Barents Sea, which exists independent of the opening or closing of the sounds. The enhanced mixing due to the fine-scale wind forcing favors a more homogenized modelled water column at the onset of freezing. Wind governs the surface water distribution, which indicates that fine-scale wind forcing in addition to fine-scale thermal forcing, are necessary to improve the representation of the source water of brine-enriched shelf water (BSW) at the onset of freezing and hence, BSW itself.},

Prior to any interpretation, raw data must be processed to remove noise and to align mass-spectral peaks across samples. This step requires selection of dataset-specific parameters, as erroneous parameters can result in noise inflation. While several algorithms exist to automate parameter selection, each depends on gradient descent optimization functions. In contrast, our new parameter optimization algorithm, AutoTuner, obtains parameter estimates from raw data in a single step as opposed to many iterations. Here, we tested the accuracy and the run time of AutoTuner in comparison to isotopologue parameter optimization (IPO), the most commonly-used parameter selection tool, and compared the resulting parameters‚Äô influence on the quality of feature tables after processing. We performed a Monte Carlo experiment to test the robustness of AutoTuner parameter selection, and found that AutoTuner generated similar parameter estimates from random subsets of samples. We conclude that AutoTuner is a desirable alternative to existing tools, because it is scalable, highly robust, and very fast (‚àº100-1000X speed improvement from other algorithms going from days to minutes).

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Climate change is affecting the rate of carbon cycling, particularly in the Arctic. Permafrost degradation through deeper thaw and physical disturbances results in the release of carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere and to an increase in lateral dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluxes. Whereas riverine DOM fluxes of the large Arctic rivers are well assessed, knowledge is limited with regard to small catchments that cover more than 40\&thinsp;\% of the Arctic drainage basin. Here, we use absorption measurements to characterize changes in DOM quantity and quality in a low Arctic (Herschel Island, Yukon, Canada) and a high Arctic (Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada) setting with regard to geographical differences, impacts of permafrost degradation, and rainfall events. We find that DOM quantity and quality is controlled by differences in vegetation cover and soil organic carbon content (SOCC). The low Arctic site has higher SOCC and greater abundance of plant material resulting in higher chromophoric dissolved organic matter (cDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than in the high Arctic. DOC concentration and cDOM in surface waters at both sites show strong linear relationships similar to the one for the great Arctic rivers. We used the optical characteristics of DOM such as cDOM absorption, specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), ultraviolet (UV) spectral slopes (S275‚Äì295), and slope ratio (SR) for assessing quality changes downstream, at base flow and storm flow conditions, and in relation to permafrost disturbance. DOM in streams at both sites demonstrated optical signatures indicative of photodegradation downstream processes, even over short distances of 2000\&thinsp;m. Flow pathways and the connected hydrological residence time control DOM quality. Deeper flow pathways allow the export of permafrost-derived DOM (i.e. from deeper in the active layer), whereas shallow pathways with shorter residence times lead to the export of fresh surface- and near-surface-derived DOM. Compared to the large Arctic rivers, DOM quality exported from the small catchments studied here is much fresher and therefore prone to degradation. Assessing optical properties of DOM and linking them to catchment properties will be a useful tool for understanding changing DOM fluxes and quality at a pan-Arctic scale.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Model experiments reproduce three salient observations, even when all DOC compounds are equally degradable: (i) {\textgreater}15\% of an initial DOC pulse resists degradation, but is consumed by microbes if concentrated, (ii) the modelled deep-sea DOC reaches stable concentrations of 30‚Äì40 mmolC/m3, and (iii) the mean age of deep-sea DOC is several times the age of deep water with a wide range from 10,000 years.

	abstract = {Benthic foraminifera have been widely used as proxy for paleo-methane emissions, mainly based on their stable isotopic signature. In cold seeps, the ecology of these organisms remains uncertain, in particular their ability to thrive during active phases of seepage. In this study, we evaluate the benthic foraminiferal response to methane seepage in Arctic sediments. We do so by examining living and dead benthic foraminiferal assemblages ({\textgreater}63 ¬µm) of eleven push cores collected in two of the most active pockmarks (Lunde and Lomvi) along Vestnesa Ridge, offshore western Svalbard. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages are interpreted in the context of sediment geochemistry, seafloor images, and pore water analyses, which are used to characterize the different microhabitats. At the sampling locations, methane is currently being released making these the ideal sites to investigate the connection between the benthic foraminiferal distribution and methane seepage in the Arctic Ocean. Our results show that benthic calcareous foraminifera live in methane charged sediments, even if the faunal density and diversity is low. We note that the eutrophic-tolerant species Melonis barleeanus withstand the methane-induced hostile geochemical conditions and that it seems to prosper on the additional food availability represented by microbial mats growing at methane seeps. We also observe that the methane transport mechanisms affect different species differently. For example, sediments characterized by advective-like conditions are distinguished by a high density of living individuals, dominated by Cassidulina neoteretis, whereas sediments characterized by methane diffusion exhibit a very low faunal density. Agglutinated foraminifera are less abundant in sediments influenced by methane seepage, suggesting that this group of foraminifera does not tolerate the geochemical conditions at seeps. A comparison between the size fractions {\textgreater}63 and {\textgreater}125 ¬µm highlights the importance of studying the finer size fraction for ecological studies in the Arctic Ocean. In the light of our results, we conclude that benthic foraminiferal can thrive at active methane seeps, where assemblages are clearly affected by methane flux.},

	abstract = {Fluvial networks are globally relevant for the processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM). To investigate the change in molecular DOM diversity along the river course, high-field FTICR mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy of riverine DOM as well as bacterial abundance and activity were measured in a third order stream along a land-use gradient from pristine, agricultural to urban landscapes. DOM composition showed a clear evolution along the river course with an initial decrease of average oxidation and unsaturation followed by an increased relative abundance of CHNO and CHOS compounds introduced by agriculture and waste water, respectively. DOM composition was dominated by rather unsaturated CHO compounds (H/C‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ1) in headwaters and by more aliphatic molecules at downstream sites. Oxygenated functional groups shifted from aromatic ethers and hydroxyl groups to aliphatic carboxylic acids and aliphatic hydroxyl groups. This massive dislocation of oxygen significantly increased the diversity of atomic environments in branched aliphatic groups from headwater to downstream DOM. Mass spectra of DOM enabled the detection of compositional relationships to bacterial abundance and activity which was positively related to more aliphatic components (H/C‚ÄØ{\textgreater}‚ÄØ1) and negatively related to unsaturated components. FTICR mass and NMR spectra corroborated the initial decline in DOM molecular diversity predicted by the River Continuum Concept (RCC) but demonstrated an anthropogenic increase in the molecular diversity of DOM further downstream. While the high DOM molecular diversity in first order headwater streams was the result of small scale ecosystem plurality, agriculture and waste water treatment introduced many components in the lower reaches. These anthropogenic influences together with massive bacterial oxidation of DOM contributed to a growth of molecular diversity of downstream DOM whose composition and structure differed entirely from those found in pristine headwaters.},

	abstract = {Nontargeted approaches using metabolomics to analyze metabolites that occur in the oceans is less developed than those for terrestrial and limnic ecosystems. One of the challenges in marine metabolomics is that salt limits metabolite analysis in seawater to methods requiring salt removal. Building on previous sample preparation methods for metabolomics, we developed SeaMet, which overcomes the limitations of salt on metabolite detection. Considering that the oceans contain the largest dissolved organic matter pool on Earth, describing the marine metabolome using nontargeted approaches is critical for understanding the drivers behind element cycles, biotic interactions, ecosystem function, and atmospheric CO2 storage. Our method complements both targeted marine metabolomic investigations as well as other ‚Äúomics‚Äù (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) approaches by providing an avenue for studying the chemical interaction between marine microbes and their habitats., Microbial communities exchange molecules with their environment, which plays a major role in regulating global biogeochemical cycles and climate. While extracellular metabolites are commonly measured in terrestrial and limnic ecosystems, the presence of salt in marine habitats limits the nontargeted analyses of the ocean exometabolome using mass spectrometry (MS). Current methods require salt removal prior to sample measurements, which can alter the molecular composition of the metabolome and limit the types of compounds detected by MS. To overcome these limitations, we developed a gas chromatography MS (GC-MS) method that avoids sample altering during salt removal and that detects metabolites down to nanomolar concentrations from less than 1 ml of seawater. We applied our method (SeaMet) to explore marine metabolomes in vitro and in vivo. First, we measured the production and consumption of metabolites during the culture of a heterotrophic bacterium, Marinobacter adhaerens. Our approach revealed successional uptake of amino acids, while sugars were not consumed. These results show that exocellular metabolomics provides insights into nutrient uptake and energy conservation in marine microorganisms. We also applied SeaMet to explore the in situ metabolome of coral reef and mangrove sediment porewaters. Despite the fact that these ecosystems occur in nutrient-poor waters, we uncovered high concentrations of sugars and fatty acids, compounds predicted to play a key role for the abundant and diverse microbial communities in coral reef and mangrove sediments. Our data demonstrate that SeaMet advances marine metabolomics by enabling a nontargeted and quantitative analysis of marine metabolites, thus providing new insights into nutrient cycles in the oceans., IMPORTANCE Nontargeted approaches using metabolomics to analyze metabolites that occur in the oceans is less developed than those for terrestrial and limnic ecosystems.

	abstract = {Heat and freshwater transports through Fram Strait are understood to have a significant influence on the hydrographic conditions in the Arctic Ocean and on water mass modifications in the Nordic seas. To determine these transports and their variability reliable estimates of the volume transport through the strait are required. Current meter moorings were deployed in Fram Strait from September 1997 to September 1999 in the framework of the EU MAST III Variability of Exchanges in the Northern Seas programme. The monthly mean velocity fields reveal marked velocity variations over seasonal and annual time scales, and the spatial structure of the northward flowing West Spitsbergen Current and the southward East Greenland Current with a maximum in spring and a minimum in summer. The volume transport obtained by averaging the monthly means over two years amounts to 9.5 ¬± 1.4 Sv to the north and 11.1 ¬± 1.7 Sv to the south (1 Sv = 106 m3s‚àí1). The West Spitsbergen Current has a strong barotropic and a weaker baroclinic component; in the East Greenland Current barotropic and baroclinic components are of similar magnitude. The net transport through the strait is 4.2 ¬± 2.3 Sv to the south. The obtained northward and southward transports are significantly larger than earlier estimates in the literature; however, within its range of uncertainty the balance obtained from a two year average is consistent with earlier estimates.},

	abstract = {The bioreactivity or susceptibility of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to microbial degradation in streams and rivers is of critical importance to global change studies, but a comprehensive understanding of DOM bioreactivity has been elusive due, in part, to the stunningly diverse assemblages of organic molecules within DOM. We approach this problem by employing a range of techniques to characterize DOM as it flows through biofilm reactors: dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, excitation emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs), and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. The EEMs and mass spectral data were analyzed using a combination of multivariate statistical approaches. We found that 45\% of stream water DOC was biodegraded by microorganisms, including 31‚Äì45\% of the humic DOC. This bioreactive DOM separated into two different groups: (1) H/C centered at 1.5 with O/C 0.1‚Äì0.5 or (2) low H/C of 0.5‚Äì1.0 spanning O/C 0.2‚Äì0.7 that were positively correlated (Spearman ranking) with chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM, respectively). DOM that was more recalcitrant and resistant to microbial degradation aligned tightly in the center of the van Krevelen space (H/C 1.0‚Äì1.5, O/C 0.25‚Äì0.6) and negatively correlated (Spearman ranking) with CDOM and FDOM. These findings were supported further by principal component analysis and 2-D correlation analysis of the relative magnitudes of the mass spectral peaks assigned to molecular formulas. This study demonstrates that our approach of processing stream water through bioreactors followed by EEMs and FTICR-MS analyses, in combination with multivariate statistical analysis, allows for precise, robust characterization of compound bioreactivity and associated molecular level composition.},

	abstract = {The performance of a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analyzer operating on the principle of high-temperature combustion (HTC) is subject to numerous design and operation characteristics. Here we describe modifications and performance tests of a commercial HTC analyzer (MQ Scientific, model MQ-1001), many of which are applicable to other HTC instruments. Design improvements include a new combustion column, auto-sampler needle assembly, and a smaller sparger/water trap that automatically maintains constant water level and pH. Techniques for monitoring and compensating for carrier gas flow rate fluctuations, as well as electronic improvements to the auto-sampler advance control and the high-pressure injection gas pulse, are also described. A new model LICOR 7000, nondispersive IR (NDIR) detector is shown to provide a 50-fold increase in sensitivity over the previous LICOR 6252 model. The total blank for the modified instrument is initially ‚àº27 ng C and declines during use to ‚àº9 ng C as the combustion column ages. For an instrument with a well-conditioned combustion column, approximately half of this background is resolvable into a reagent component coming largely from the deionized, UV-irradiated (DUV) water used to rinse the sample onto the combustion column: the other half is intrinsic to the instrument and appears associated with the quartz bead packing. Injection of varying volumes of DUV water with and without an added constant C background, indicates that our DUV water contains between 2 and 9 ŒºM DOC, depending on the variable performance of the water purifier. Similar experiments indicate that the intrinsic instrument blank is variable over time and depends complexly on both the wait time between individual water injections and the overall time that the combustion column has been conditioned. The modified instrument fitted with the new LICOR 7000 detector measures 46.1¬±1.3 ŒºM DOC in Sargasso Sea water reference material (44‚Äì45 ŒºM) against a total instrument blank equivalent to about a fourth of this value. Overall, the modified MQ-1001 analyzer is capable of dependable, automated analysis of relatively challenging deep seawater samples with an average accuracy of about ¬±3.8\% of the consensus value.},

Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the anaerobic oxidation of methane because data describing the distribution and abundance of putative anaerobic methanotrophs in relation to rates and patterns of anaerobic oxidation of methane activity are rare. An integrated biogeochemical, molecular ecological and organic geochemical approach was used to elucidate interactions between the anaerobic oxidation of methane, methanogenesis, and sulfate reduction in sediments from two cold seep habitats (one brine site, the other a gas hydrate site) along the continental slope in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. The results indicate decoupling of sulfate reduction from anaerobic oxidation of methane and the contemporaneous occurrence of methane production and consumption at both sites. Phylogenetic and organic geochemical evidence indicate that microbial groups previously suggested to be involved in anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate reduction were present and active. The distribution and isotopic composition of lipid biomarkers correlated with microbial distributions, although concrete assignment of microbial function based on biomarker profiles was complicated given the observed overlap of competing microbial processes. Contemporaneous activity of anaerobic oxidation of methane and bicarbonate-based methanogenesis, the distribution of methane-oxidizing microorganisms, and lipid biomarker data suggest that the same microorganisms may be involved in both processes.},

	abstract = {The West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) is a topographically steered boundary current that transports warm Atlantic Water northward in Fram Strait. The 16 yr (1997‚Äì2012) current and temperature‚Äìsalinity measurements from moorings in the WSC at 788500N reveal the dynamics of mesoscale variability in the WSC and the central Fram Strait. A strong seasonality of the Ô¨Çuctuations and the proposed driving mechanisms is described. In winter, water is advected in the WSC that has been subjected to strong atmospheric cooling in the Nordic Seas, and as a result the stratiÔ¨Åcation in the top 250 m is weak. The current is also stronger than in summer and has a greater vertical shear. This results in an e-folding growth period for baroclinic instabilities of about half a day in winter, indicating that the current has the ability to rapidly grow unstable and form eddies. In summer, the WSC is signiÔ¨Åcantly less unstable with an e-folding growth period of 2 days. Observations of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) show a peak in the boundary current in January‚ÄìFebruary when it is most unstable. Eddies are then likely advected westward, and the EKE peak is observed 1‚Äì2 months later in the central Fram Strait. Conversely, the EKE in the WSC as well as in the central Fram Strait is reduced by a factor of more than 3 in late summer. Parameterizations for the expected EKE resulting from baroclinic instability can account for the observed EKE values. Hence, mesoscale instability can generate the observed variability, and high-frequency wind forcing is not required to explain the observed EKE.},

Density compensating, fine-scale (1‚Äì10-m thick) temperature-salinity contrasts in the water column result in small changes in sound speed and appear as distinct reflector layers, if processing gains are sufficiently high. Recent studies image low-frequency (10‚Äì150Hz) returns that are specular reflections from laterally continuous steps or sheets in the ocean‚Äôs temperature-depth structure. With the very dense lateral sampling of reflection profiling (order 10m), exceptional detail can be seen in the structure of oceanic reflectors throughout portions of the water column. Spectacular images of thermohaline fine structure in the ocean include features such as intrusions, internal waves, and mesoscale eddies. The discovery of seismic reflections from the water column and the ability to image large volumes of the ocean at full depth and at high lateral resolution opens up new possibilities for probing the structure of the ocean.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The deep sea, the largest biome on Earth, has a series of characteristics that make this environment both distinct from other marine and land ecosystems and unique for the entire planet. This review describes these patterns and processes, from geological settings to biological processes, biodiversity and biogeographical patterns. It concludes with a brief discussion of current threats from anthropogenic activities to deep-sea habitats and their fauna. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Investigations of deep-sea habitats and their fauna began in the late 19th century. In the intervening years, technological developments and stimulating discoveries have promoted deep-sea research and changed our way of understanding life on the planet. Nevertheless, the deep sea is still mostly unknown and current discovery rates of both habitats and species remain high. The geological, physical and geochemical settings of the deep-sea floor and the water column form a series of different habitats with unique characteristics that support specific faunal communities. Since 1840, 28 new habitats/ecosystems have been discovered from the shelf break to the deep trenches and discoveries of new habitats are still happening in the early 21st century. However, for most of these habitats the global area covered is unknown or has been only very roughly estimated; an even smaller ‚Äì indeed, minimal ‚Äì proportion has actually been sampled and investigated. We currently perceive most of the deep-sea ecosystems as heterotrophic, depending ultimately on the flux on organic matter produced in the overlying surface ocean through photosynthesis. The resulting strong food limitation thus shapes deep-sea biota and communities, with exceptions only in reducing ecosystems such as inter alia hydrothermal vents or cold seeps. Here, chemoautolithotrophic bacteria play the role of primary producers fuelled by chemical energy sources rather than sunlight. Other ecosystems, such as seamounts, canyons or cold-water corals have an increased productivity through specific physical processes, such as topographic modification of currents and enhanced transport of particles and detrital matter. Because of its unique abiotic attributes, the deep sea hosts a specialized fauna. Although there are no phyla unique to deep waters, at lower taxonomic levels the composition of the fauna is distinct from that found in the upper ocean. Amongst other characteristic patterns, deep-sea species may exhibit either gigantism or dwarfism, related to the decrease in food availability with depth. Food limitation on the seafloor and water column is also reflected in the trophic structure of heterotrophic deep-sea communities, which are adapted to low energy availability. In most of these heterotrophic habitats, the dominant megafauna is composed of detritivores, while filter feeders are abundant in habitats with hard substrata (e.g. mid-ocean ridges, seamounts, canyon walls and coral reefs). Chemoautotrophy through symbiotic relationships is dominant in reducing habitats. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Deep-sea biodiversity is among of the highest on the planet, mainly composed of macro and meiofauna, with high evenness. This is true for most of the continental margins and abyssal plains with hot spots of diversity such as seamounts or cold-water corals. However, in some ecosystems with particularly "extreme" physicochemical processes (e.g. hydrothermal vents), biodiversity is low but abundance and biomass are high and the communities are dominated by a few species. Two large-scale diversity patterns have been discussed for deep-sea benthic communities. First, a unimodal relationship between diversity and depth is observed, with a peak at intermediate depths (2000‚Äì3000 m), although this is not universal and particular abiotic processes can modify the trend. Secondly, a poleward trend of decreasing diversity has been discussed, but this remains controversial and studies with larger and more robust data sets are needed. Because of the paucity in our knowledge of habitat coverage and species composition, biogeographic studies are mostly based on regional data or on specific taxonomic groups. Recently, global biogeographic provinces for the pelagic and benthic deep ocean have been described, using environmental and, where data were available, taxonomic information. This classification described 30 pelagic provinces and 38 benthic provinces divided into 4 depth ranges, as well as 10 hydrothermal vent provinces. One of the major issues faced by deep-sea biodiversity and biogeographical studies is related to the high number of species new to science that are collected regularly, together with the slow description rates for these new species. Taxonomic coordination at the global scale is particularly difficult, but is essential if we are to analyse large diversity and biogeographic trends. {\textless}br.{\textless}br{\textgreater} Because of their remoteness, anthropogenic impacts on deep-sea ecosystems have not been addressed very thoroughly until recently. The depletion of biological and mineral resources on land and in shallow waters, coupled with technological developments, are promoting the increased interest in services provided by deep-water resources. Although often largely unknown, evidence for the effects of human activities in deep-water ecosystems ‚Äì such as deep-sea mining, hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, fishing, dumping and littering ‚Äì is already accumulating. Because of our limited knowledge of deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and because of the specific life-history adaptations of many deep-sea species (e.g. slow growth and delayed maturity), it is essential that the scientific community works closely with industry, conservation organisations and policy makers to develop robust and efficient conservation and management options.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The microbial degradation of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, DON) was studied in three Finnish boreal estuaries with contrasting land use patterns (Kiiminkijoki ‚Äì natural forest and peatland; Kyr√∂njoki ‚Äì agricultural; Karjaanjoki ‚Äì mixed/urban). Bioassays of 12‚Äì18 d long durations were used in 3 seasons at in situ temperatures. Besides the bulk parameters, a suite of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality parameters were also investigated, including colored DOM (CDOM), fluorescent DOM and the molecular weight of DOM. Bioavailable DOC and DON pools varied significantly between the estuaries, from 7.9 to 10.6\% and from 5.5 to 21.9\%, respectively. DOM originating from the catchment dominated by natural forests and peatlands (Kiiminkijoki) had the lowest DOC and DON degradation rates, as well as the lowest proportions of biodegradable DOC and DON. A greater proportion of agricultural land in the catchment increased the bioavailability of DON, but not the bioavailability of DOC (Kyr√∂njoki). Additionally, DOM quality varied significantly between the estuaries, and DOM originating from the agricultural Kyr√∂njoki catchment sustained higher DOC and DON degradation rates and higher bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) compared to those of the natural forest and peat dominated Kiiminkijoki catchment. The quality of DOM, indicated by differences in CDOM, fluorescent DOM and molecular weight, varied between estuaries with differing land use and was concluded to be major driver of BGE of these systems and thereafter to the microbial CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ fluxes from the estuaries. The differences in BGE resulted in a 5-fold difference in the calculated daily bacterial CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ emissions between the study's estuaries due to bacterial activity, ranging from 40 kg C d$^{\textrm{‚àí1}}$ in the Karjaanjoki estuary to 200 kg C d$^{\textrm{‚àí1}}$ in the Kyr√∂njoki estuary. Lower DOC:DON ratios, smaller molecular weight and higher CDOM absorption spectral slope values of DOM resulted in higher proportion of the initial DOC and DON being transferred to microbial growth and therefore to the pelagic food web. The pristine, peatland and forest-dominated Kiiminkijoki catchment had the lowest BGE, and therefore proportionally highest CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ fluxes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract A large amount of warm Atlantic water (AW) enters the Arctic as a boundary current through Fram Strait (West Spitsbergen Current [WSC]) and is the major oceanic heat source to the Arctic Ocean. Along the north-western Svalbard shelf, the WSC splits into the shallow Svalbard Branch, the Yermak Branch that follows the slope of the Yermak Plateau, and the Yermak Pass Branch flowing across the plateau. The WSC has previously been studied using moorings, dedicated oceanographic transects, and models. In this study, we mapped the circulation patterns and AW flow around Svalbard using Vessel-Mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler data from multiple surveys during four consecutive summers (2014?2017). Despite the scattered nature of this compiled data set, persistent circulation patterns could be discerned. Spatial interpolation showed a meandering boundary current west of Svalbard and a more homogeneous AW flow, centered around the 1,000-m isobath north of Svalbard. In all summers, we observed a northward jet between 79 and 80¬∞N and the 1,000- and 500-m isobaths, before the WSC divided into the three branches. North of Svalbard, the shallow Svalbard Branch reunited with the Yermak Pass Branch between 10 and 15¬∞E and a part of the AW circulated within Hinlopen Trench. The calculated volume transport of 2¬†Sv in the upper 500¬†m compares well with model results and previous observations. Our results further show that the Yermak Pass Branch can be as important as the Svalbard Branch in transporting AW across the Yermak Plateau during summer.},

This program has provided two decades of continuous monitoring data at over 140 Ô¨Åxed stations in 28 estuaries. However, the increasing quantity of data provided by the monitoring network has complicated broad-scale comparisons between systems and, in some cases, prevented simple trend analysis of water quality parameters at individual sites. This article describes the SWMPr package that provides several functions that facilitate data retrieval, organization, and analysis of time series data in the reserve estuaries. Previously unavailable functions for estuaries are also provided to estimate rates of ecosystem metabolism using the open-water method. The SWMPr package has facilitated a cross-reserve comparison of water quality trends and links quantitative information with analysis tools that have use for more generic applications to environmental time series.},

	abstract = {Summary Microbes and sunlight convert terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters to greenhouse gases. Prior studies show contrasting results about how biological and photochemical processes interact to contribute to the degradation of DOM. In this study, DOM leached from the organic layer of tundra soil was exposed to natural sunlight or kept in the dark, incubated in the dark with the natural microbial community, and analyzed for gene expression and DOM chemical composition. Microbial gene expression (metatranscriptomics) in light and dark treatments diverged substantially after 4?h. Gene expression suggested that sunlight exposure of DOM initially stimulated microbial growth by (a) replacing the function of enzymes that degrade higher molecular weight DOM such as enzymes for aromatic carbon degradation, oxygenation, and decarboxylation, and (b) releasing low molecular weight compounds and inorganic nutrients from DOM. However, growth stimulation following sunlight exposure of DOM came at a cost. Sunlight depleted the pool of aromatic compounds that supported microbial growth in the dark treatment, ultimately causing slower growth in the light treatment over 5?days. These first measurements of microbial metatranscriptomic responses to photo-alteration of DOM provide a mechanistic explanation for how sunlight exposure of terrigenous DOM alters microbial processing and respiration of DOM.

The results obtained by MCR-ALS provided information about the compositional changes of the different DOM sources (i.e. humic-, fulvic- or protein-like sources) present in the investigated river samples, about their site distribution along the river basin and about their changes in three different monitoring campaigns. Eight different MCR-ALS components were resolved describing several types of DOM, with different excitation and emission spectra and with distinct distribution profiles along the river sampling sites. A comparative study of each single sampling site describing the changes in their DOM composition during the three monitoring campaigns was also performed.},

	abstract = {Coastal waters of the English Channel and the North Sea are affected by a massive spring phytoplankton bloom event of the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis globosa every year. The impact of this bloom on DOM dynamics in coastal waters of the western English Channel was investigated through a 45 d long mesocosm experiment and field survey (2012‚Äì2014). Our results highlight that, over short time scales, marine production of DOM mostly affects CDOM absorption properties in the UV domain. Specifically, it has been evidenced that the acdom spectral slope between 320 nm and 412 nm (S320-412) can be used as a relevant indicator of the DOM marine origin. The presence of a strong linear relationship between S320-412 and the DOC specific absorption coefficient in phytoplankton bloom conditions reveals that this optical parameter provides complementary information to those obtained from the spectral slope between 275 nm and 295 nm, S275-295 which has been recently described as a relevant tracer of the terrestrial DOM and a good descriptor of the specific absorption coefficient of dissolved organic carbon variability in the confining river-influenced ocean margins. This study has further demonstrated that the joint use of S275-295 and S320-412 significantly improves the estimation DOC-specific absorption coefficient in the presence of varying contribution of marine and terrestrial DOM. While such bands are still not available on ocean color sensors, this methodology represents a valuable tool for estimating DOC concentration from CDOM absorption measurements from in situ data obtained from classical discrete measurements or from autonomous platforms equipped with adapted spectrophotometer.},

	abstract = {Recent research has focused on the changing ability of oceans to absorb atmospheric CO2 and the consequences for ocean acidification, with Arctic shelf seas being among the most sensitive regions. Hudson Bay is a large shelf sea in northern Canada whose location at the margin of the cryosphere places it in the vanguard of global climate change. Here, we develop a four-compartment box-model and carbon budget using published and recently collected measurements to estimate carbon inputs, transformations, and losses within Hudson Bay. We estimate the annual effects of terrestrial carbon remineralization on aragonite saturation (Œ©Ar, a proxy for ocean acidification) and on the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2, a proxy for air-sea CO2 flux) within each compartment, as well as the effects of marine primary production, marine organic carbon remineralization, and terrestrial calcium carbonate dissolution. We find that the remineralization of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon is the main driver of CO2 accumulation and aragonite under-saturation in coastal surface waters, but this is largely offset by marine primary production. Below the surface mixed layer, marine organic carbon remineralization is the largest contributor to CO2 accumulation and aragonite under-saturation, and is partially offset by terrestrial CaCO3 dissolution. Overall, the annual delivery and processing of carbon reduces Œ©Ar of water flowing through HB by up to 0.17 units and raises pCO2 by up to 165 ¬µatm. The similarities between Hudson Bay and other Arctic shelf seas suggest these areas are also significantly influenced by terrestrial carbon inputs and transformation.},

	abstract = {We investigate methane seepage on the shallow shelf west of Svalbard during three consecutive years, using discrete sampling of the water column, echosounder-based gas flux estimates, water mass properties, and numerical dispersion modelling. The results reveal three distinct hydrographic conditions in spring and summer, showing that the methane content in the water column is controlled by a combination of free gas seepage intensity and lateral water mass movements, which disperse and displace dissolved methane horizontally away from the seeps. Horizontal dispersion and displacement of dissolved methane are promoted by eddies originating from the West Spitsbergen Current and passing over the shallow shelf, a process that is more intense in winter and spring than in the summer season. Most of the methane injected from seafloor seeps resides in the bottom layer even when the water column is well mixed, implying that the controlling effect of water column stratification on vertical methane transport is small. Only small concentrations of methane are found in surface waters, and thus the escape of methane into the atmosphere above the site of seepage is also small. The magnitude of the sea to air methane flux is controlled by wind speed, rather than by the concentration of dissolved methane in the surface ocean.},

It is important to understand the processes by which DOM is recycled, particularly as changes in the oceanic DOM pool could affect atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on timescales of 1,000 to 10,000 years (ref. 1). It is commonly believed that low-molecular-weight material, which comprises 65-80\% of DOM2‚Äì5, is rapidly remineralized, and that high-molecular-weight material is refractory. But the average age of DOM in the deep ocean is about 6,000 years (ref. 6) which implies that a large proportion of the DOM cycles only very slowly. Here we present a study of the relative bioavailability of low- and high-molecular weight DOM in water samples taken from the northern Gulf of Mexico during a diatom bloom. Bacterial growth and respiration in the presence of high-molecular-weight DOM were respectively three and six times greater than for low-molecular-weight material. Although both of these pools undoubtedly contain mixtures of compounds with varying reactivities and turnover times, our results demonstrate that the bulk of oceanic DOM comprises small molecules that cycle slowly and are relatively unavailabe to microorganisms.},

We use ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to elucidate molecular changes in snowpack DOM by in situ microbial processes (up to 55 days) in a coastal Antarctic site. Both autochthonous and allochthonous DOM is highly bioavailable and is transformed by resident microbial communities through parallel processes of degradation and synthesis. DOM thought to be of a more refractory nature, such as dissolved black carbon and carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules, was also rapidly and extensively reworked. Microbially reworked DOM exhibits an increase in the number and magnitude of N-, S-, and P-containing formulas, is less oxygenated, and more aromatic when compared to the initial DOM. Shifts in the heteroatom composition suggest that microbial processes may be important in the cycling of not only C, but other elements such as N, S, and P. Microbial reworking also produces photoreactive compounds, with potential implications for DOM photochemistry. Refined measurements of supraglacial DOM and their cycling by microbes is critical for improving our understanding of supraglacial DOM cycling and the biogeochemical and ecological impacts of DOM export to downstream environments.},

Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an abundant and critical component in wetland biogeochemistry. This study describes the first detailed, comparative, molecular characterization of DOM in subtropical, pulsed, wetlands, namely the Everglades (USA), the Pantanal (Brazil) and the Okavango Delta (Botswana), using optical properties, high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICRMS), and compares compositional features to variations in organic matter sources and flooding characteristics (i.e., differences in hydroperiod). While optical properties showed a high degree of variability within and between the three wetlands, analogies in DOM fluorescence properties were such that an established excitation emission matrix fluorescence parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) model for the Everglades was perfectly applicable to the other two wetlands. Area-normalized $^{\textrm{1}}$H NMR spectra of selected samples revealed clear distinctions of samples while a pronounced congruence within the three pairs of wetland DOM readily suggested the presence of an individual wetland-specific molecular signature. Within sample pairs (long- vs. short-hydroperiod sites), internal differences mainly referred to intensity variations (denoting variable abundance) rather than to alterations of NMR resonances positioning (denoting diversity of molecules). The relative disparity was largest between the Everglades long- and short-hydroperiod samples, whereas Pantanal and Okavango samples were more alike among themselves. Otherwise, molecular divergence was most obvious in the case of unsaturated protons (\textit{Œ¥}$_{\textrm{H}}$ \&gt; 5 ppm). 2-D NMR spectroscopy for a particular sample revealed a large richness of aliphatic and unsaturated substructures, likely derived from microbial sources such as periphyton in the Everglades. In contrast, the chemical diversity of aromatic wetland DOM likely originates from a combination of higher plant sources, progressive microbial and photochemical oxidation, and contributions from combustion-derived products (e.g., black carbon). FT-ICRMS spectra of both Okavango and Pantanal showed near 57 ¬± 2 \% CHO, 8 ¬± 2 \% CHOS, 33 ¬± 2 \% CHNO and \&lt; 1 \% CHNOS molecules, whereas those of Everglades samples were markedly enriched in CHOS and CHNOS at the expense of CHO and CHNO compounds. In particular, the Everglades short-hydroperiod site showed a large set of aromatic and oxygen-deficient ‚Äúblack sulfur‚Äù compounds whereas the long-hydroperiod site contained oxygenated sulfur attached to fused-ring polyphenols. The elevated abundance of CHOS compounds for the Everglades samples likely results from higher inputs of agriculture-derived and sea-spray-derived sulfate. Although wetland DOM samples were found to share many molecular features, each sample was unique in its composition, which reflected specific environmental drivers and/or specific biogeochemical processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR/MS) is the best MS technology for obtaining exact mass measurements owing to its great resolution and accuracy, and several outstanding FT-ICR/MS-based metabolomics approaches have been reported. A reliable annotation scheme is needed to deal with direct-infusion FT-ICR/MS metabolic profiling. Correlation analyses can help us not only uncover relations between the ions but also annotate the ions originated from identical metabolites (metabolite derivative ions). In the present study, we propose a procedure for metabolite annotation on direct-infusion FT-ICR/MS by taking into consideration the classification of metabolite-derived ions using correlation analyses. Integrated analysis based on information of isotope relations, fragmentation patterns by MS/MS analysis, co-occurring metabolites, and database searches (KNApSAcK and KEGG) can make it possible to annotate ions as metabolites and estimate cellular conditions based on metabolite composition. A total of 220 detected ions were classified into 174 metabolite derivative groups and 72 ions were assigned to candidate metabolites in the present work. Finally, metabolic profiling has been able to distinguish between the growth stages with the aid of PCA. The constructed model using PLS regression for OD600 values as a function of metabolic profiles is very useful for identifying to what degree the ions contribute to the growth stages. Ten phospholipids which largely influence the constructed model are highly abundant in the cells. Our analyses reveal that global modification of those phospholipids occurs as E. coli enters the stationary phase. Thus, the integrated approach involving correlation analyses, metabolic profiling, and database searching is efficient for high-throughput metabolomics.},

          Organic matter (OM) metabolism in freshwater ecosystems is a critical source of uncertainty in global biogeochemical cycles, yet aquatic OM cycling remains poorly understood. Here, we present the first work to explicitly test OM thermodynamics as a key regulator of aerobic respiration, challenging long-held beliefs that organic carbon and oxygen concentrations are the primary determinants of respiration rates. We pair controlled microcosm experiments with ultrahigh-resolution OM characterization to demonstrate a clear relationship between OM thermodynamic favorability and aerobic respiration under carbon limitation. We also demonstrate a shift in the regulation of aerobic respiration from OM thermodynamics to nitrogen content when carbon is in excess, highlighting a central role for OM thermodynamics in aquatic biogeochemical cycling particularly in carbon-limited ecosystems. Our work therefore illuminates a structural gap in aquatic biogeochemical models and presents a new paradigm in which OM thermodynamics and nitrogen content interactively govern aerobic respiration.},

Elevated nutrient levels can adversely affect nearshore corals by reducing the amount of light reaching the benthos, exacerbating coral disease and bleaching, as well as stimulating algal growth, but the effects on other reef taxa are poorly understood. We investigated the effects of dissolved inorganic nutrient enrichment and changes in irradiance on the growth and condition of 5 common Great Barrier Reef sponges: 4 sponges with photosynthetic symbionts and 1 lacking photosynthetic symbionts. Concentrations of up to 7 ¬µM total dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) did not significantly affect the growth, condition, or chl a content of any sponge species after 10 wk exposure. However, 2 species lost {\textgreater} 20\% volume across all nutrient treatments, suggesting that aquarium conditions may have been suboptimal for these species. Irradiance (80 vs. 160 ¬µmol quanta m‚àí2 s‚àí1) did not affect 4 of the 5 sponge species; however, higher irradiance resulted in higher organic content and chl a levels in the bioeroding sponge Cliona orientalis, the only studied species that associates with the photosynthetic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium, suggesting that sponge‚àíSymbiodinium associations may be more sensitive to irradiance levels than sponge‚àí Cyanobacteria associations. While elevated nutrient levels are exacerbating the decline of reefbuilding corals, exposure to the average DIN levels within flood plumes that reach inshore reefs appears to have negligible effects on reef sponges.},

	abstract = {Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) varies in its recalcitrance to rapid microbial degradation. DOM of varying recalcitrance can be exported from the ocean surface to depth by subduction or convective mixing and oxidized over months to decades in deeper seawater. Carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) are characterized as a major component of recalcitrant DOM throughout the oceanic water column. The oxidation of CRAM-like compounds may depend on specific bacterioplankton lineages with oxidative enzymes capable of catabolizing complex molecular structures like long-chain aliphatics, cyclic alkanes, and carboxylic acids. To investigate the interaction between bacteria and CRAM-like compounds, we conducted microbial remineralization experiments using several compounds rich in carboxyl groups and/or alicyclic rings, including deoxycholate, humic acid, lignin, and benzoic acid, as proxies for CRAM. Mesopelagic seawater (200 m) from the northwest Sargasso Sea was used as media and inoculum and incubated over 28 d. All amendments demonstrated significant DOC removal (2‚Äì11 Œºmol C L‚àí1) compared to controls. Bacterioplankton abundance increased significantly in the deoxycholate and benzoic acid treatments relative to controls, with fast-growing Spongiibacteracea, Euryarcheaota, and slow-growing SAR11 enriched in the deoxycholate treatment and fast-growing Alteromonas, Euryarcheaota, and Thaumarcheaota enriched in the benzoic acid treatment. In contrast, bacterioplankton grew slower in the lignin and humic acid treatments, with oligotrophic SAR202 becoming significantly enriched in the lignin treatment. Our results indicate that the character of the CRAM proxy compounds resulted in distinct bacterioplankton removal rates of DOM and affected specific lineages of bacterioplankton capable of responding.},

We developed a conceptual framework using the metabolic fingerprint of entire ecosystems (MeE) to facilitate the discovery of global bioactivity hotspots. We assessed the MeE of 305 sites of diverse aquatic ecosystems, worldwide. All samples were tested for antiviral effects against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), followed by a comprehensive screening for cell-modulatory activity by High-Content Screening (HCS). We discovered a very strong HIV-1 inhibition mainly in samples taken from fjords with a strong terrestrial input. Multivariate data integration demonstrated an association of a set of polyphenols with specific biological alterations (endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and NFkB) caused by these samples. Moreover, we found strong HIV-1 inhibition in one unrelated oceanic sample closely matching to HIV-1-inhibitory drugs on a cytological and a chemical level. Taken together, we demonstrate that even without physical purification, a sophisticated strategy of differential filtering, correlation analysis, and multivariate statistics can be employed to guide chemical analysis, to¬†improve de-replication, and to identify ecosystems with promising characteristics as sources for NP discovery.},

Here, we present a novel approach for in situ extraction of organic compounds from hydrothermal vent fluids through a unique solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampler. These samplers were deployed to sample effluent of vents on sulphide chimneys, located on Axial Seamount in the North-East Pacific, in the Urashima field on the southern Mariana back-arc, and at the Hafa Adai site in the central Mariana back-arc. Among the compounds that were extracted, a wide range of unique organic compounds, including labile dissolved organic sulfur compounds, were detected through high-resolution LC-MS/MS, among which were biomarkers of anammox bacteria, fungi, and lower animals. This report is the first to show that SPME can contribute to a broader understanding of deep sea ecology and biogeochemical cycles in hydrothermal vent ecosystems.},

The Amundsen Sea Polynya (ASP) serves as a natural test basin for assessing the fate of deep-DOC when it is supplied with a large amount of fresh-DOC and exposed to strong solar radiation during the polynya opening in austral summer. We measured the radiocarbon content of DOC in the water column on the western Amundsen shelf. The radiocarbon content of DOC in the surface water of the ASP reflected higher primary production than in the region covered by sea ice. The radiocarbon measurements of DOC, taken two years apart in the ASP, were different, suggesting rapid cycling of DOC. The increase in DOC concentration was less than expected from the observed increase in radiocarbon content from those at the greatest depths. Based on a radiocarbon mass balance, we show that deep-DOC is consumed along with fresh-DOC in the ASP. Our observations imply that water circulation through the surface layer, where fresh-DOC is produced, may play an important role in global DOC cycling.},

	abstract = {The release of methane from the seafloor into the water column within the hydrate stability field (HSF) is a natural and widely observed process. The subsequent bubble dissolution rate determines how far upwards gas is transported and the vertical distribution of this methane source to the water column. Understanding this process is essential to describing natural deep sea seeps, to assess the hazard potential from blowouts in offshore drilling activities for gas and oil, and to refine past and future scenarios of global change involving large-scale destabilization of gas hydrates and free methane gas. We report on in situ experiments on single methane and argon bubbles within and above the HSF for depths from 400 to 1500¬†m. Single bubbles were injected from the ROV Ventana into an attached, back-illuminated, flow-through imaging box. The ascent of individual bubbles within the imaging box was recorded and analyzed for rise velocity, VB, and radius shrinkage rate, dr/dt. For all bubbles VB={\textasciitilde}30¬†cms‚àí1. Methane bubbles released within the HSF had markedly enhanced lifetimes, attributed to hydrate skin formation. dr/dt varied from ‚àí7.5¬†Œºm s‚àí1 above the HSF to ‚Äì1¬†Œºm s‚àí1 at 1500¬†m, well within the HSF. Bubble longevity within the HSF increased with distance into the P/T-space from the hydrate phase boundary. There was a delay prior to the slower dissolution, where dr/dt for methane bubbles was comparable to dr/dt above the HSF, which was interpreted as a time delay before the onset of hydrate skin formation. Although variable, the onset time generally decreased with distance from the hydrate phase boundary. No delay was observed for the deepest releases. We relate these findings to formal calculations of methane solubility and density as a function of pressure. Pressure-dependent deviations from ideal gas law and Henry's law were implemented in a numerical bubble-propagation model which incorporated the effects of decreased solubility and surface mobility after hydrate formation. Inclusion of these effects greatly improved model prediction of observed methane bubble behavior within the HSF. The effect of these individual depth-related effects on bubble dissolution rate and longevity then was assessed quantitatively, and assumptions of different gas solubility prior and after hydrate nucleation or an effect of hydrates at the interface on the hydrodynamics at the surface were tested. Here, our approach implements our current knowledge on physicochemical and hydrodynamic control and does not seek the best fit for the given data sets, thus it also reveals current uncertainties in methane bubble processes in the HSF.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Coastal seas may account for more than 75 \% of global oceanic methane emissions. There, methane is mainly produced microbially in anoxic sediments from which it can escape to the overlying water column. Aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) in the water column acts as a biological filter, reducing the amount of methane that eventually evades to the atmosphere. The efficiency of the MOx filter is potentially controlled by the availability of dissolved methane and oxygen, as well as temperature, salinity, and hydrographic dynamics, and all of these factors undergo strong temporal fluctuations in coastal ecosystems. In order to elucidate the key environmental controls, specifically the effect of oxygen availability, on MOx in a seasonally stratified and hypoxic coastal marine setting, we conducted a 2-year time-series study with measurements of MOx and physico-chemical water column parameters in a coastal inlet in the south-western Baltic Sea (Eckernf√∂rde Bay). We found that MOx rates generally increased toward the seafloor, but were not directly linked to methane concentrations. MOx exhibited a strong seasonal variability, with maximum rates (up to 11.6 nmol L$^{\textrm{‚àí1}}$ d$^{\textrm{‚àí1}}$) during summer stratification when oxygen concentrations were lowest and bottom-water temperatures were highest. Under these conditions, 2.4‚Äì19.0 times more methane was oxidized than emitted to the atmosphere, whereas about the same amount was consumed and emitted during the mixed and oxygenated periods. Laboratory experiments with manipulated oxygen concentrations in the range of 0.2‚Äì220 ¬µmol L$^{\textrm{‚àí1}}$ revealed a submicromolar oxygen optimum for MOx at the study site. In contrast, the fraction of methane‚Äìcarbon incorporation into the bacterial biomass (compared to the total amount of oxidized methane) was up to 38-fold higher at saturated oxygen concentrations, suggesting a different partitioning of catabolic and anabolic processes under oxygen-replete and oxygen-starved conditions, respectively. Our results underscore the importance of MOx in mitigating methane emission from coastal waters and indicate an organism-level adaptation of the water column methanotrophs to hypoxic conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Previous studies have begun to map out associations between diet and the bacteria and viruses of the human gut microbiome. Here we investigate associations of diet with fungal and archaeal populations, taking advantage of samples from 98 well-characterized individuals. Diet was quantified using inventories scoring both long-term and recent diet, and archaea and fungi were characterized by deep sequencing of marker genes in DNA purified from stool. For fungi, we found 66 genera, with generally mutually exclusive presence of either the phyla Ascomycota or Basiodiomycota. For archaea, Methanobrevibacter was the most prevalent genus, present in 30\% of samples. Several other archaeal genera were detected in lower abundance and frequency. Myriad associations were detected for fungi and archaea with diet, with each other, and with bacterial lineages. Methanobrevibacter and Candida were positively associated with diets high in carbohydrates, but negatively with diets high in amino acids, protein, and fatty acids. A previous study emphasized that bacterial population structure was associated primarily with long-term diet, but high Candida abundance was most strongly associated with the recent consumption of carbohydrates. Methobrevibacter abundance was associated with both long term and recent consumption of carbohydrates. These results confirm earlier targeted studies and provide a host of new associations to consider in modeling the effects of diet on the gut microbiome and human health.},

	abstract = {Chlorophyll and phaeopigment determinations on fresh water and marine samples of phytoplankton have shown that the following considerations are important in routine pigment analyses. (a) Methanol should be used as extraction solvent instead of acetone due to better extraction efficiency, shorter extraction time, and elimination of the need to boil or homogenize the samples. (b) For spectrophotometric determinations of phaeopigments, the methanol extracts should be acidified with HCl to a final concentration of 3√ó 10$^{\textrm{-3}}$ M. (c) When a spectrophotometer is used for phaeopigment determination, subsequent neutralization of the acidified methanol extracts to the original pH is required; fluorometric determinations do not require this neutralization. (d) The addition of MgCO$_{\textrm{3}}$ to filters or to extracts is not necessary. (e) There is no detectable loss of chlorophyll when either sample extracts or wet filters are stored at -20¬∞C for three weeks and then extracted with either acetone or methanol. (f) Glass fiber filters are effective in retaining all phytoplankton and have some advantages over membrane filters. /// –û–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏—è —Ö–ª–æ—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª–ª–∞ –∏ —Ñ–µ–æ–ø–∏–≥–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –≤ –ø—Ä–æ–±–∞—Ö –ø—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏ –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–∏—Ç–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–∫—Ç–æ–Ω–∞ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ –≤ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–µ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞ –ø–∏–≥–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –∏–º–µ—é—Ç –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∏–µ —Å–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è: –∞/ –¥–ª—è —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–ª–µ–¥—É–µ—Ç –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—ä–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç—ä –≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –∞—Ü–µ—Ç–æ–Ω–∞ –º–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–ª, –æ–±–ª–∞–¥–∞—é—â–∏–π –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–æ–π —ç—Ñ—Ñ–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ä—é —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏–∏, –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –∫–æ—Ä–æ—Ç–∫–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ä—é —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏–∏, –Ω–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–±—É—é—â–µ–π –∫–∏–ø—è—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏–ª–∏ –≥–æ–º–æ–≥–µ–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–±; –±/ –¥–ª—è —Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–æ—Ç–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π —Ñ–µ–æ–ø–∏–≥–º–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ –º–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≤—ã–µ —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç—ã –¥–æ–ª–∫–Ω—ã –±—ã—Ç—ä –ø–æ–¥–∫–∏—Å–ª–µ–Ω—ã —Å–æ–ª—è–Ω–æ–π –∫–∏—Å–ª–æ—Ç–æ–π –¥–æ –æ–∫–æ–Ω—á–∞—Ç–µ–ª—ä–Ω–æ–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ 3√ó 10$^{\textrm{-3}}$ –º; –≤/ –ø—Ä–∏ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—ä—ç–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ —Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–æ—Ç–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∞ –¥–ª—è –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ñ–µ–æ—Ñ–µ—Ä–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—ä–Ω–∞—è –Ω–µ–π—Ç—Ä–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è –ø–æ–¥–∫–∏—Å–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –º–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≤—ã—Ö —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –¥–æ –∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π —Ä–Ω. —Ñ–ª{\textbackslash}r=,?{\textbackslash}–æ—Ä–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–±—É{\textbackslash}r=,?{\textbackslash}—Ç –Ω–µ–π—Ç—Ä–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏; –≥/ –¥–æ–±–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ MgCO$_{\textrm{3}}$ –∫ —Ñ–∏–ª—ä—Ç—Ä—É –∏–ª–∏ —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç—É –Ω–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–±—É–µ—Ç—Å—è; –¥/ –ø—Ä–∏ —Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–æ–± –∏–ª–∏ –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–∏–ª—ä—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–∏ -20¬∞ –≤ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ 3-—Ö –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª—ä —Å –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥—É{\textbackslash}r=,?{\textbackslash}—â–µ–π —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏–µ–π –∞—Ü–µ—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–º –∏–ª–∏ –º–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–ª–æ–º –∑–∞–º–µ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—Ç–µ—Ä—ä —Ö–ª–æ—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª–ª–∞–Ω–µ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ; –µ/ —Ñ–∏–ª—ä—Ç—Ä—ã –∏–∑ —Å—Ç–µ–∫–ª—è–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–æ–ª–æ–∫–Ω–∞ —ç—Ñ—Ñ–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ —É–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–≤–∞{\textbackslash}r=,?{\textbackslash}—Ç –≤–µ—Å—ä —Ñ–∏—Ç–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–∫—Ç–æ–Ω –∏ –∏–º–µ{\textbackslash}r=,?{\textbackslash}—Ç –ø—Ä–µ–∏–º—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥ –º–µ–º–±—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ —Ñ–∏–ª—ä—Ç—Ä–∞–º–∏.},

	abstract = {Advances in sampling tools, analytical methods and data handling capabilities have been fundamental to the growth of marine organic biogeochemistry over the past four decades. There has always been a strong feedback between analytical advances and scientific advances. However, whereas advances in analytical technology were often the driving force that made possible progress in elucidating the sources and fate of organic matter in the ocean in the first decades of marine organic biogeochemistry, today process-based scientific questions should drive analytical developments. There are several paradigm shifts and challenges for the future that are related to the intersection between analytical progress and scientific evolution. Untargeted ‚Äúmolecular headhunting‚Äù for its own sake is now being subsumed into process-driven targeted investigations that ask new questions and thus require new analytical capabilities. However, there are still major gaps in characterizing the chemical composition and biochemical behavior of macromolecules. Field-based measurements are now routinely complemented by controlled laboratory experiments and in-situ rate measurements of key biogeochemical processes. And finally, the multidisciplinary investigations that are becoming more common generate large and diverse datasets, requiring innovative computational tools to integrate often disparate data sets, including better global coverage and mapping. Here, we compile examples of developments in analytical methods that have made possible transformative advances over the past decade, and we project some challenges and opportunities for the future to insure continued progress in understanding the cycling of organic carbon in the ocean.},

	abstract = {The vast majority of freshly produced oceanic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is derived from marine phytoplankton, then rapidly recycled by heterotrophic microbes. A small fraction of this DOC survives long enough to be routed to the interior ocean, which houses the largest and oldest DOC reservoir. DOC reactivity depends upon its intrinsic chemical composition and extrinsic environmental conditions. Therefore, recalcitrance is an emergent property of DOC that is analytically difficult to constrain. New isotopic techniques that track the flow of carbon through individual organic molecules show promise in unveiling specific biosynthetic or degradation pathways that control the metabolic turnover of DOC and its accumulation in the deep ocean. However, a multivariate approach is required to constrain current carbon fluxes so that we may better predict how the cycling of oceanic DOC will be altered with continued climate change. Ocean warming, acidification, and oxygen depletion may upset the balance between the primary production and heterotrophic reworking of DOC, thus modifying the amount and/or composition of recalcitrant DOC. Climate change and anthropogenic activities may enhance mobilization of terrestrial DOC and/or stimulate DOC production in coastal waters, but it is unclear how this would affect the flux of DOC to the open ocean. Here, we assess current knowledge on the oceanic DOC cycle and identify research gaps that must be addressed to successfully implement its use in global scale carbon models.},

Following that, we present examples of four frontiers that have been explored recently, focusing as much as possible at the molecular level and on marine water columns: (i) how analytical advances and informatics tools provide new insight into the chemical nature and cycling of dissolved organic matter; (ii) how evolving studies of suspended and sinking particles play an important role in understanding ocean biogeochemistry; (iii) the new symbiosis between marine microbiology, analytical chemistry and organic geochemistry as illustrated by the archaea, their habitats, lipid biomarkers, and influence on geochemical cycles; and (iv) how advances in compound-specific measurements of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur isotopes shed new light on sources and behavior of marine organic matter. We cite selected recent (primarily the past two decades) research examples as a basis for further reading and to project into the future some aspects of these research areas that could be further developed.

We attempted to separate individual structural isomers from several samples using online reversed-phase chromatography with selected ion monitoring/tandem mass spectrometry, but found that isomeric complexity still presented a boundary to investigation even after chromatographic simplification of the samples. However, it was possible to determine that the structural complexity differed among samples. Our results also suggest that extreme structural complexity was a ubiquitous feature of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in all aquatic systems, meaning that this diversity may play similar roles for recalcitrance and degradation of DOM in all tested environments.},

	abstract = {Carbon release due to permafrost thaw represents a potentially major positive climate change feedback. The magnitude of carbon loss and the proportion lost as methane (CH4) vs. carbon dioxide (CO2) depend on factors including temperature, mobilization of previously frozen carbon, hydrology, and changes in organic matter chemistry associated with environmental responses to thaw. While the first three of these effects are relatively well understood, the effect of organic matter chemistry remains largely unstudied. To address this gap, we examined the biogeochemistry of peat and dissolved organic matter (DOM) along a ‚àº40-y permafrost thaw progression from recently- to fully thawed sites in Stordalen Mire (68.35¬∞N, 19.05¬∞E), a thawing peat plateau in northern Sweden. Thaw-induced subsidence and the resulting inundation along this progression led to succession in vegetation types accompanied by an evolution in organic matter chemistry. Peat C/N ratios decreased whereas humification rates increased, and DOM shifted toward lower molecular weight compounds with lower aromaticity, lower organic oxygen content, and more abundant microbially produced compounds. Corresponding changes in decomposition along this gradient included increasing CH4 and CO2 production potentials, higher relative CH4/CO2 ratios, and a shift in CH4 production pathway from CO2 reduction to acetate cleavage. These results imply that subsidence and thermokarst-associated increases in organic matter lability cause shifts in biogeochemical processes toward faster decomposition with an increasing proportion of carbon released as CH4. This impact of permafrost thaw on organic matter chemistry could intensify the predicted climate feedbacks of increasing temperatures, permafrost carbon mobilization, and hydrologic changes.},

	abstract = {The high-resolution and mass accuracy of Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FT-MS) has made it an increasingly popular technique for discerning the composition of soil, plant and aquatic samples containing complex mixtures of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, lignins, hydrocarbons, phytochemicals and other compounds. Thus, there is a growing demand for informatics tools to analyze FT-MS data that will aid investigators seeking to understand the availability of carbon compounds to biotic and abiotic oxidation and to compare fundamental chemical properties of complex samples across groups. We present ftmsRanalysis, an R package which provides an extensive collection of data formatting and processing, filtering, visualization, and sample and group comparison functionalities. The package provides a suite of plotting methods and enables expedient, flexible and interactive visualization of complex datasets through functions which link to a powerful and interactive visualization user interface, Trelliscope. Example analysis using FT-MS data from a soil microbiology study demonstrates the core functionality of the package and highlights the capabilities for producing interactive visualizations.},

Among these, Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (FT-ICR/MS) is distinguished from other MS technologies by its ultrahigh resolution power in mass to charge ratio (m/z). The potential of FT-ICR/MS as a distinctive metabolomics tool has been demonstrated in nontargeted metabolic profiling and functional characterization of novel genes.

In this review, we will highlight developments in the application of high-field Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) in identifying the individual components of complex NOM mixtures, focusing primarily on the fraction that is dissolved in natural waters (dissolved organic matter or DOM). We will first provide some historical perspective on developments in FTICR technology that made molecular-level characterizations of DOM possible.

However, the effect of dynamic methanotrophic activities in the widely-distributed seafloor methane seeps on brGDGTs distributions in global continent margins remains enigmatic. In this study, we firstly report the occurrence of in situ produced brGDGTs in cold seep environments, based on the analysis of tetraether lipid distributions in the authigenic carbonates collected from the northern section of the Okinawa Trough (OT). The abundance ratio of isoGDGTs to brGDGTs (Ri/b) was much lower in the authigenic carbonates (0.94 to 2.25) than in the adjacent normal marine sediments ({\textgreater}10) and suspended particulate matter ({\textgreater}60) in the East China Sea (ECS). Such significant higher bacterial branched GDGTs ratios in the authigenic carbonates indicate its additional sources besides terrestrial and/or water column inputs. Specifically, the brGDGT (Ia), brGDGT (IIa) and brGDGT (IIa‚Äô) appear to form in situ in cold seeps, and are influenced by the methane flux significantly as indicated by the fractional abundances of GDGTs along the transect of pipes, network analysis, and correlations between Methane Index (MI) and brGDGTs. Our study highlights that the distributions of seafloor methane seeps could impact the bacterial tetraether lipid distributions in ocean, which would hamper the universal application of brGDGT-based proxies for terrigenous organic carbon tracing and paleoclimate reconstruction in marine environments.},

Pore water analyses show very shallow sulphate methane transition zones and transport-reaction modelling suggests a considerable amount of dissolved methane passing through the sediment water interface due to upwards advection of an aqueous fluid not previously reported from Vestnesa Ridge. In addition, we show that the amount of methane that bypasses the benthic methane filter greatly increases with higher aqueous fluid advection rate. Recent changes in methane flux are evident from lipid biomarker, seep carbonate, and Œ¥13C-organic carbon profiles in both pockmarks. Hydrocarbons at this cold seep site are supplied both by deep thermogenic sources from below the gas hydrate stability zone but also to a significant degree by microbial methanogenesis which dominates the signature in our shallow sediment cores with Œ¥13C‚ÄìCH4 values as low as ‚àí77‚Ä∞.},

DOM analysis commonly utilizes electrospray ionization (ESI), while some have implemented other techniques, including dopant-assisted atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI). We compared various extracted DOM compositions analyzed by negative ESI and positive APPI doped with both toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF), including a fragmentation study of THF-doped riverine DOM using infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD). DOM compositions followed the same trends in ESI and dopant-assisted APPI with the latter presenting saturated, less oxygenated, and more N-containing compounds than ESI. Between the APPI dopants, THF-doping yielded spectra with more aliphatic-like and N-containing compounds than toluene-doping. We further demonstrate how fragmentation of THF-doped DOM in APPI resolved subtle differences between riverine DOM that was absent from ESI. In both ionization methods, we describe a linear relationship between atomic and formulaic N-compositions from a range of DOM extracts. This study highlights that THF-doped APPI is useful for uncovering low-intensity aliphatic and peptide-like components in autochthonous DOM, which could aid environmental assessments of DOM across biolability gradients.},

	abstract = {Cell lysis, as a consequence of adverse conditions, has been recognized as an important loss process among phytoplankton, in addition to the well-known loss processes of grazing and sinking. Cell lysis has been connected to increased release of carbon fixed by phytoplankton as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the primary carbon source for pelagic heterotrophic bacteria. This has the potential to enhance pelagic remineralization at the cost of reduced sedimentation of organic carbon. Cell lysis may, therefore, have global consequences as the ratio of pelagic remineralization to sedimentation widely determines whether oceans function as a source or a sink of atmospheric carbon. However, the subject has been studied predominantly in oceans and oligotrophic marine regions. The Baltic Sea is different from these environments and the causes and consequences of phytoplankton cell lysis may, therefore, be expected to differ. 
 
The studies included in this thesis are the first attempt to study phytoplankton cell lysis and its effect on carbon cycling in the Baltic Sea. The focus of the thesis is mainly on elucidating the abiotic and biological controls of cell lysis and its relationship with pelagic DOC concentration. These were studied on a spatial scale during a spring bloom on an area covering the Gulf of Finland, the √Öland Sea and the Baltic Proper, and on a temporal scale during a two-year long monitoring campaign in an estuary in the northern Gulf of Finland. In both studies the proportion of cells undergoing lysis was measured using a membrane impermeable nucleic acid stain to indicate cells with compromised membrane integrity.  
 
The spatial monitoring study revealed considerable variation in the proportion of cells undergoing lysis with generally higher proportion of dying cells in deep water (1-10 m: average 84\%, range 67-91\%; 30 m: average 77\%, range 62-90\%; 60 m: average 71\%, range 58-86\%) and among nanophytoplankton (surface water average: 64\%), as compared to smaller eukaryotic picophytoplankton (surface water average: 88\%) and picocyanobacteria  (surface water average: 82\%). No clear correlations between cell lysis and nutrient concentrations were found, although there was a weak correlation between the proportion of intact eukaryotic picophytoplankton and phosphate concentration (R2 = 0.13, p = 0.029). No connection between cell lysis and DOC concentration was found. Also during the temporal monitoring campaign variation of cells undergoing lysis was high (surface water average: 62\%, range 18-97\%). Again, no correlation between nutrient concentrations and cell lysis was found, although this time there was a weak negative relationship between the proportion of cells undergoing lysis and DOC concentration (R2 = 0.15, p = 0.0185). In both studies some indication was found that phytoplankton lysis is less prevalent in conditions where interspecific phytoplankton competition is low. 
 
Details of the flow of carbon from phytoplankton to pelagic heterotrophic bacteria was studied experimentally using two phytoplankton species (a dinoflagellate Apocalathium malmogiense and a cryptophyte Rhodomonas marina). Contrasting species specific differences were found in their ability to transfer carbon from the inorganic pool via DOC to bacterial biomass and in the composition of the emerging bacterial community. The smaller R. marina released more bioavailable DOC and attracted a bacterial community mainly consisting of copiotrophs (bacteria thriving when DOC is abundant and highly bioavailable), which likely directs more carbon towards microbial loop. The DOC released by the larger A. malmogiense was less bioavailable. If these results can be generalized to other taxa of similar size, the fast consumption of DOC released by R. marina may partially explain why no relationship between the lysis of small phytoplankton and DOC concentration was found. 
 
The overarching conclusion from the two field studies is that the environmental conditions, such as nutrient limitation, that have been shown to promote cell lysis in oligotrophic marine regions are not the main determinants of cell lysis in the Baltic Sea. Also, the high ambient DOC concentration and terrestrial runoff in the Baltic Sea seem to mask the effect of cell lysis on DOC concentration. The group and species specific differences in both cell lysis and carbon cycling indicate that investigating cell lysis on lower taxonomic levels will help to connect cell lysis to carbon cycling.},

In this study, the cryoconite holes, which are subjected to different light conditions were monitored in the coastal Antarctica during the summer in order to determine how the geochemistry of these environments varied through the melt season. Additionally, mesocosm experiments were conducted to understand the impact of photochemical and microbial activities on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ionic constituents in the snow and cryoconite holes. In-situ measurements of primary and bacterial production carried out in the surface snow and cryoconite holes showed that the primary production rates were higher than the bacterial production rates. Both photochemical and microbial processes resulted in changing the concentration of DOC, carboxylate and nitrate ions in these environments. Sunlight-induced production of biologically labile compounds such as acetate and formate, and photochemical degradation of oxalate were also observed. Microbial activity had the opposite effect, resulting in an increase in oxalate and decrease in acetate and formate concentrations. Consequences of these combined processes would determine the fate of DOC and associated nutrients in the Antarctic supraglacial environments and potentially influence the local productivity within these systems.},

In this work, we focus on the study of methane and DOM distribution and genesis in the ground ice samples of thermodenudational exposure in the Central Yamal (Russian Arctic). We propose that the liberation of the ice-trapped CH4 and generation of CO2 by DOM mineralization are the earliest factors of atmospheric greenhouse gases emission as a result of permafrost thawing. The observed enormously \&ldquo;light \&rdquo; isotope signatures of methane (\&delta;13C \&lt; \&minus;80\&permil;, \&delta;D \&lt; \&minus;390\&permil;) found in the tabular ground ice units significantly divergent in morphology and localization within the exposuremay be related to subzero (cryogenic) carbonate reduction a as significant factor of the local methane enrichment. DOM is mainly formed (\&gt;88\%) by biochemically refractory humic acids. Distribution of the labile protein-like DOM reflects the specific features of carbon and nitrogen cycles in the tabular ground ice and ice wedge samples. Tabular ground ice units are shown to be a significant source of methane and high quality organic matter as well as dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Ice wedges express a high variation in DOM composition and lability.},

	abstract = {Marine organic matter (OM) sinks from surface water to the seafloor via the biological pump. Benthic communities, which use this sedimented OM as an energy and carbon source, produce dissolved OM (DOM) in the process of degradation, enriching the sediment pore water with fresh DOM compounds. In the oligotrophic deep Arctic basin, particle flux is low but highly seasonal. We hypothesized that the molecular signal of freshly deposited, primary produced OM would be detectable in surface sediment pore water, which should differ in DOM composition from bottom water and deeper sediment pore water. The study focused on (i) the molecular composition of the DOM in sediment pore water of the deep Eurasian Arctic basins, (ii) the signal of marine vs. terrigenous DOM represented by different compounds preserved in the pore water and (iii) the relationship between Arctic Ocean ice cover and DOM composition. Composition based on mass spectrometric information, obtained via 15T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, was correlated with environmental parameters with partial least square analysis. The fresh marine detrital OM signal from surface water was limited to pore water from {\textless}5cm sediment depth. The productive ice margin stations showed a higher abundance of peptide, unsaturated aliphatic and saturated fatty acid molecular formulae, indicative of recent phytodetritus deposition, than the multiyear ice-covered stations, which had a stronger aromatic signal. The study contributes to the understanding of the coupling between Arctic Ocean productivity and its depositional regime, and how it may be altered in response to sea ice retreat and increasing river runoff.},

	abstract = {Marine sediments are globally significant sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the oceans, but the biogeochemical role of pore-water DOM in the benthic and marine carbon cycles remains unclear due to a lack of understanding about its molecular composition. To help fill this knowledge gap, we used 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to examine depth variability in the composition of pore-water DOM in anoxic sediments of Santa Barbara Basin, California Borderland. Proton detected spectra were acquired on whole samples without pre-concentration to avoid preclusion of any DOM components from the analytical window. Broad unresolved resonance (operationally assigned to carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules, or CRAM) dominated all spectra. Most of the relatively well-resolved peaks (attributed to biomolecules or their derivatives) appeared at chemical shifts similar to those previously reported for marine DOM in the literature, but at different relative intensities. DOM composition changed significantly within the top 50 cm of the sediment column, where the relative intensity of CRAM increased, and the relative intensity of resolved resonances decreased. The composition of CRAM itself also changed throughout the entire length of the 4.5-m profile, as CRAM protons became increasingly aliphatic at the expense of functionalized protons. Given that pore-water DOM is generated from sedimentary organic matter that includes pre-aged and degraded material, and that DOM could theoretically be subjected to microbial reworking in the pore waters for centuries to millennia, these data suggest that marine sediments may be sources of CRAM that are compositionally unique from CRAM generated in the upper ocean.},

Due to the complexity of biogeochemical processes and historically compartmentalized subdisciplines, ecosystem-specific conceptualizations of OM degradation have emerged independently of developments in other ecosystems. Recent discussions regarding the relative importance of molecular composition and ecosystem properties on OM degradation have diverged in opposing directions across subdisciplines, leaving our understanding inconsistent. Ecosystem-dependent theories are problematic since properties unique to an ecosystem may change in response to anthropogenic stressors, including climate change. The next breakthrough in our understanding of OM degradation requires a shift in focus towards developing a unified theory of controls on OM across ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The Arctic Ocean is highly susceptible to climate change as evidenced by rapid warming and the drastic loss of sea ice during summer. The consequences of these environmental changes for the microbial cycling of organic matter are largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the distribution and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along with heterotrophic bacterial activity in seawater and sea ice of the Eurasian Basin at the time of the record ice minimum in 2012. Bacteria in seawater were highly responsive to fresh organic matter and remineralized on average 55\% of primary production in the upper mixed layer. Correlation analysis showed that the accumulation of dissolved combined carbohydrates (DCCHO) and dissolved amino acids (DAA), two major components of fresh organic matter, was related to the drawdown of nitrate. Nitrate-depleted surface waters at stations adjacent to the Laptev Sea showed about 25\% higher concentrations of DAA than stations adjacent to the Barents Sea and in the central Arctic basin. Carbohydrate concentration was the best predictor of heterotrophic bacterial activity in sea ice. In contrast, variability in sea-ice bacterial biomass was largely driven by differences in ice thickness. This decoupling of bacterial biomass and activity may mitigate the negative effects of biomass loss due to ice melting on heterotrophic bacterial functions. Overall, our results reveal that changes in DOM production and inventories induced by sea-ice loss have a high potential to enhance the bacterial remineralization of organic matter in seawater and sea ice of the Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {The main reservoirs of global carbon (C) cycle are the atmosphere, the biosphere, the oceans, and the lithosphere. The atmospheric C inventory consists of almost entirely carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) with the current (2015) atmospheric concentration of 400 ppm and 1845 ppb for CO2 and CH4, respectively. This is equivalent to atmospheric burden of nearly 849 and 3.7 Pg C for CO2 and CH4, respectively, compared to 589 and 1.49 Pg C in 1750 at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Most of the increase since the begining of Industrial Era is associated with the anthropogenic activities of fossil fuel combustion and land use change. The terrestrial biosphere contains C in living biomass of the terrestrial ecosystem and soils. The estimated C in living biomass range from 450 to 700 Pg, while soils contains an estimate of 1500‚Äì2400 Pg as soil organic C (SOC) and 720‚Äì930 Pg C as soil inorganic C (SIC) in the top 3 m depth. The terrestrial SOC is dominantly preserved in forest biomass and soils. The ocean C inventory amounts to 39,000 Pg, of which, only 700‚Äì900 Pg C exist in the surface water layer which is in direct contact with the atmosphere. More than 90\% of C is present as bicarbonate (HCO3 ‚àí). Additional 2500 Pg C is present in marine carbonate (CO3 2‚àí) sediments which are gradually transformed into sedimentary rock over the geological timescale. Of the dissolved CO2 inventory in the ocean, 170 ¬± 20 Pg is of anthropogenic, with an estimated uptake of {\textasciitilde}3.0 ¬± 0.5 Pg C yr‚àí1 in 2015. The distribution of C in the ocean is regulated by three processes: biological pump, solubility pump and thermocline circulation. The lithosphere, consisting of Earth crust and mantle is the largest reservoir of C. The C in Earth crust is estimated at 7.8 √ó 107 Pg, of which, 20\% is in organic C (OC)‚Äîmostly as fossil fuels‚Äîcoal, oil and natural gas. An estimated 420 ¬± 20 Pg C from the fossil C has been released to the atmosphere as CO2 since the Industrial Revolution.},

Sea-ice loss may also deliver more methane to the atmosphere, but warmer ice may release fewer halogens, resulting in fewer ozone depletion events. The net changes in carbon drawdown are still highly uncertain.

Despite methodological advancements that provide increasingly more detailed information on the diversity of both prokaryotic communities and DOM components, understanding how these two component parts are structured to influence ecosystem functioning remains a major challenge in microbial ecology. Using empirical data collected along a gradient of productivity in the Labrador Sea, we characterized relationships among DOM compounds, metabolic processing, and prokaryotic diversity by structuring prokaryotic communities using spatial abundance distribution (SpAD) modeling. We identified strong associations of different SpAD taxonomic groups with specific organic substrates as well as with metabolic rates. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with more cosmopolitan distributions (i.e. normal-like) such as Bacteroidia were related to fresher DOM substrates such as free and combined amino acids whereas rare ASVs (i.e. logistic) like Œ¥-proteobacteria were associated with complex forms of organic matter. In terms of ecosystem function, rates of respiration and production were most strongly predicted by the abundance of certain SpAD taxonomic groups. Given the importance and complexity of linking environmental conditions, prokaryotic community structure, and ecosystem function, we propose a framework to bridge the gap between prokaryotic diversity, microbial ecology, and biogeochemistry among methods and across scales. Our work suggests that SpAD modeling can be used as an intermediate step to link prokaryotic community structure to both finer DOM details and larger ecosystem scale processes.},

	abstract = {In coastal regions, rivers and streams may be important sources of nutrients limiting to primary production in marine waters; however, sampling is still only rarely conducted across the land-to-ocean aquatic continuum, precluding conclusions from being drawn about connectivity between freshwater and marine systems. Here we use a more than four year dataset (2014-2018) of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, silica, iron) and dissolved organic carbon spanning streams draining coastal 20 watersheds and nearshore marine surface waters along the Central Coast of British Columbia Canada, at the heart of the North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest region. Mean freshwater and surface marine N:Si:P ratios were 4:18:1 (P:Fe = 1:58) and 6:11:1, respectively, showing relative consistency across the land-ocean interface but deviation from the extended Redfield ratio. Inorganic nutrient concentrations (NO3-+NO2-, PO43-, Si(OH)4) in freshwaters were less than in the receiving marine environment, indicating that freshwater nutrient inputs in this region were of little importance to - or even diluted - the pool of 25 readily available inorganic nutrients in nearshore waters. Conversely, freshwaters increased the pool of organic matterassociated nutrients, namely dissolved organic nitrogen and iron. The organic matter-rich landscapes of the region yielded globally significant quantities of dissolved organic nitrogen (304-381 kg km-2 y-1) and iron (463-596 kg km-2 y-1); thus acting as important sources of potentially limiting nutrients to both nearshore and offshore waters. These exports may subsidise heterotrophic microbial communities capable of directly consuming and remineralising these nutrients, potentially 30 compensating for the dilution of inorganic nutrients by freshwater inputs. We highlight the need to better understand nutrient limitation in coastal waters and for concerted research efforts to study the spatial and temporal dynamism at the land-ocean interface along the northeast Pacific coast.},

Watersheds draining temperate rainforests, peatlands, glaciers, and three large rivers that flow from the drier interior of the Yukon Territory and British Columbia, discharge water and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into southeast Alaskan coastal waters. This area, which we have designated the southeast Alaska drainage basin (SEAKDB), discharges about twice as much water as the Columbia or Yukon Rivers. An understanding of the timing, location, and source of water and DOC guide research to better understand the influence of terrestrial outputs on the adjacent marine systems. Additionally, a spatially extensive understanding of riverine DOC flux will improve our understanding of lateral losses related to terrestrial carbon cycling. We estimate 1.17 Tg C yr-1 of DOC enters the adjacent marine system along with 430 km2 of freshwater that influences estuary, shelf, and Gulf of Alaska hydrology. We estimate that 23 to 66\% of the DOC entering coastal waters is bioavailable and may influence metabolism and productivity within the marine system. The combination of the large and spatially distributed water and DOC input, long and complex shoreline, large enclosed estuarine volume, and bounded nearshore coastal currents suggests that the physiographic structure of southeast Alaska may have a significant impact on the metabolism of riverine DOC in coastal marine ecosystems.},

To understand their implications, we operate an ocean biogeochemical model coupled to a general circulation model with sea-ice. Incorporating the effect of phytoplankton and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) on light attenuation in the model increases the sea surface temperature in summer and decreases sea-ice concentration in the Arctic Ocean. Locally, the sea-ice season is reduced by up to one month. CDOM drives a significant part of these changes, suggesting that an increase of this material will amplify the observed Arctic surface warming through its direct thermal effect. Indirectly, changing advective processes in the Nordic Seas may further intensify this effect. Our results emphasize the phytoplankton and CDOM feedbacks on the Arctic ocean and sea-ice system and underline the need to consider these effects in future modeling studies to enhance their plausibility.},

	abstract = {Coastal waters have strong gradients in dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and characteristics, originating from terrestrial inputs and autochthonous production. Enclosed seas with high freshwater input therefore experience high DOM concentrations and gradients from freshwater sources to more saline waters. The brackish Baltic Sea experiences such salinity gradients from east to west and from river mouths to the open sea. Furthermore, the catchment areas of the Baltic Sea are very diverse and vary from sparsely populated northern areas to densely populated southern zones. Coastal systems vary from enclosed or open bays, estuaries, fjords, archipelagos and lagoons where the residence time of DOM at these sites varies and may control the extent to which organic matter is biologically, chemically or physically modified or simply diluted with transport off-shore. Data of DOM with simultaneous measurements of dissolved organic (DO) nitrogen (N), carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) across a range of contrasting coastal systems are scarce. Here we present data from the Roskilde Fjord, Vistula and √ñre estuaries and Curonian Lagoon; four coastal systems with large differences in salinity, nutrient concentrations, freshwater inflow and catchment characteristics. The C:N:P ratios of DOM of our data, despite high variability, show site specific significant differences resulting largely from differences residence time. Microbial processes seemed to have minor effects, and only in spring did uptake of DON in the Vistula and √ñre estuaries take place and not at the other sites or seasons. Resuspension from sediments impacts bottom waters and the entire shallow water column in the Curonian Lagoon. Finally, our data combined with published data show that land use in the catchments seems to impact the DOC:DON and DOC:DOP ratios of the tributaries most.},

However, it remains elusive how sponge hosts and their microbial symbionts acquire and process food in these food-limited environments. Therefore, we traced the processing (i.e. assimilation and respiration) of 13C- and 15N-enriched dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bacteria by three dominant North Atlantic deep-sea sponges: the high microbial abundance (HMA) demosponge Geodia barretti, the low microbial abundance (LMA) demosponge Hymedesmia paupertas, and the LMA hexactinellid Vazella pourtalesii. We also assessed the assimilation of both food sources into sponge- and bacteria-specific phospholipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers. All sponges were capable of assimilating DOM as well as bacteria. However, processing of the two food sources differed considerably between the tested species: the DOM assimilation-to-respiration efficiency was highest for the HMA sponge, yet uptake rates were 4‚Äì5 times lower compared to LMA sponges. In contrast, bacteria were assimilated most efficiently and at the highest rate by the hexactinellid compared to the demosponges. Our results indicate that phylogeny and functional traits (e.g., abundance of microbial symbionts, morphology) influence food preferences and diet composition of sponges, which further helps to understand their role as key ecosystem engineers of deep-sea habitats.},

Currently, proteomics relies mainly on mass spectrometry (MS), but instead of truly sequencing, it classifies a protein and typically requires about a billion copies of a protein to do it. Here, we offer a survey that illuminates a few alternatives with the brightest prospects for identifying whole proteins and displacing MS for sequencing them.

A clear microbial preference for degradation of compounds associated with marine DOM relative to those of terrestrial origin was observed, resulting in an overall shift of the remaining DOM toward a stronger terrigenous signature. During short, one-day long incubations of samples rich in marine DOM, the molecular formulae that were enriched had slightly smaller mass (20-30 Da) and number of carbon atoms compared to the molecular formulae that were depleted. Over longer time scales (70 days), the mean differences in molecular mass between formulae that were depleted and enriched were substantially larger ({\textasciitilde}270 Da). The differences in elemental composition over daily time scales were consistent with transformations in functional groups; over longer time scales, the differences in elemental composition may be related to progressive transformations of functional groups of intermediate products and/or other reactions.

The vast translucent oceans are teeming with microscopic life that drives significant life processes and elemental cycling on Earth. Yet how climate change will affect the functioning of this microbiome is not well understood. Moran reviews progress and the transformative discoveries made recently in marine microbiology that have led environmental, plant, animal, and even human microbiome research.
Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aac8455
Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDOceanographers began studying the ocean microbiome in earnest over four decades ago, when it was recognized that microbes are responsible for nearly all of the energy flux in this largest and most dilute biological system on Earth. Much has been learned about the microbes that play key roles in every marine element cycle, but much is still unknown about the factors regulating their activity. Although the number of marine microbes per liter of seawater reaches into the billions, their small size means that, statistically, each microbe is separated by 100 to 200 body lengths from its closest neighbors. Yet recognition of microscale structuring of both microbial communities and marine organic matter suggests that the ocean microbiome does not operate as stand-alone cells in a watery soup.
ADVANCESSeveral decades of 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis has revealed distinct and recurring bacterial communities in the ocean. More recent characterizations of marine archaea, protists, and viruses are filling out the taxonomic inventories of the ocean microbiome and showing that membership is predictable over seasons, ocean depth, and organic matter features. The retrieval of proteorhodopsin‚Äîa gene that allows cells to harvest energy from sunlight without complex photosynthetic machinery‚Äîfrom an uncultured ocean microbe marked the first exciting discovery from the use of ‚Äúmeta-omics‚Äù methodologies in the ocean. Now these techniques are the central tools for converting inventories of organisms and functions into explicit linkages between the two. Substantial progress has been made toward unraveling how and where microbes participate in ocean biogeochemical processes, as well as toward recognizing new categories of nonpredatory microbial alliances that operate based on the exchange of nitrogen, vitamins, hormones, and antibiotics.Several characteristics of the ocean microbiome distinguish it from microbiomes on or in animals, plants, and soils. First, the primary producers that fuel the ocean are exclusively microbial and thus are a part of the microbiome. This is the case for photosynthesis in the surface ocean and for chemosynthesis carried out in deeper waters. The ocean microbiome is responsible for half of all primary production occurring on Earth. Second, trophic categories are particularly difficult to assign in the ocean microbiome, with no clear division of organisms into canonical autotrophic and heterotrophic roles. Proteorhodopsin, anoxygenic phototrophy, and chemolithotrophic energy acquisition from inorganic compounds create trophic mayhem among members of the ocean microbiome. Having multiple strategies for meeting metabolic requirements may be an advantage in this chemically dilute and physically dynamic environment. Last, heterogeneity in the structure of seawater organic matter has become a foundational concept for the ocean microbiome because it aligns with differences in microbial attributes. Bacteria and archaea that live singly in seawater differ from those that intermingle on the various marine polymer networks and organic surfaces in terms of phylogenetic affinity, metabolism, and capabilities for motility, chemotaxis, and defense. Single bacteria and archaea are numerically dominant in terms of cells, genes, and transcripts, but those clustered near surfaces have higher per-cell rates of metabolism and growth. The importance of material exchanges and signaling networks between neighboring cells in the ocean, as well as the consequences spatial arrangements impose on biogeochemical processing, are not yet understood.
OUTLOOKEarth‚Äôs changing climate is predicted to decrease carbon fixation by microbial primary producers, favor smaller picophytoplankton over larger nano- and microphytoplankton, and impose stress on photosynthetic microbes that form calcium carbonate shells. The structure of phytoplankton communities, in turn, has implications for the abundance and composition of organic substrates for heterotrophic microbes, as well as for dictating which trophic strategies will be under selection in the future ocean. Taking stock of the ocean microbiome in terms of cells, genes, transcripts, and proteins now has a long tradition in oceanography. Linking these stocks with the regulation of critical ecosystem functions is the next challenge. One key step in this process is the identification of the molecules that pass between microbes as substrates, nutrients, signaling molecules, and defensive compounds; these are the ‚Äúcurrencies‚Äù of ocean microbiome function. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/350/6266/aac8455/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Sampling the ocean microbiome.(Left) New instruments such as the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute) autonomously sample ocean microbes and environmental conditions while deployed at sea.

The microbiome of the largest environment on Earth has been gradually revealing its secrets over four decades of study. Despite the dispersed nature of substrates and the transience of surfaces, marine microbes drive essential transformations in all global elemental cycles. Much has been learned about the microbes that carry out key biogeochemical processes, but there are still plenty of ambiguities about the factors important in regulating activity, including the role of microbial interactions. Identifying the molecular ‚Äúcurrencies‚Äù exchanged within the microbial community will provide key information on microbiome function and its vulnerability to environmental change.},

We eliminated sources of labile phytoplankton products, advected terrestrial material and photodegradation products to coastal microbial communities by enclosing water samples in situ for 24 h in the dark. Bacterial genes for which expression decreased between the beginning and end of the incubation and chemical formulae that were depleted over this same time frame were used as indicators of bioavailable compounds, an approach that avoids augmenting or modifying the natural DOM pool. Transport- and metabolism-related genes whose relative expression decreased implicated osmolytes, carboxylic acids, fatty acids, sugars and organic sulfur compounds as candidate bioreactive molecules. FT-ICR MS analysis of depleted molecular formulae implicated functional groups 30‚Äì40 Da in size cleaved from semi-polar components of DOM as bioreactive components. Both gene expression and FT-ICR MS analyses indicated higher lability of compounds with sulfur and nitrogen heteroatoms. Untargeted methodologies able to integrate biological and chemical perspectives can be effective strategies for characterizing the labile microbial metabolites participating in carbon flux.},

The particular strength of the biomarker concept, as compared to DNA- or RNA-based techniques, lies in its potential to track the methane-derived processes not only in modern settings but also on a geological time scale. In the past two decades, numerous studies have provided information on the lipid inventories of the key methanotrophic biota. In addition, compound-specific isotopic measurements have become an important tool for the recognition of tracer compounds for the turnover of methane in environmental samples. After a brief introduction about methane sources and sinks, I will provide an overview about the relevant lipid biomarkers that have been reported from aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs and their habitats. Furthermore, the occurrence and utility of their diagenetic products as molecular fossils for methane carbon cycling in ancient environments will be illustrated.},

	abstract = {Methane, the simplest alkane, is one of the most important and abundant carbon molecules on Earth. It is a major supply of energy, a chemical feedstock, and a potent greenhouse gas. Aside from thermogenic, pyrogenic, and abiotic sources, methane is primarily formed in the Earth‚Äôs surface by a variety of microbial processes, i.e., methanogenesis. These processes utilize a range of pathways that involve small carbon-bearing molecules, e.g., CO2, acetate, etc. Methanogens are active in widely diverse anaerobic environments, e.g., rocks, soils, sediments, lakes, oceans, and animals, and cover a wide ecological habitats extending from ‚àí1 ¬∞C to 122 ¬∞C, pH 5 to 11, and salinities up to 100 g/L. The biogeochemical methane cycle also includes the microbial oxidation of methane, both by aerobic and anaerobic organisms and consortia, of which some pathways remain uncertain. Together with chemical oxidation, these microbial ‚Äúbiofilters‚Äù of methane are critical in controlling methane distributions. A variety of tools, including biomarker molecules, stable isotopes, and molecular gene sequencing, can characterize these formation and consumption pathways.

	abstract = {We assessed the qualitative composition of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in Arctic Ocean surface water and in sea ice north of the Svalbard Archipelago (in the Sophia Basin, the Yermak Plateau and the north Spitsbergen shelf) in May and June 2015, during the ‚ÄúTRANSSIZ‚Äù expedition (Transitions in the Arctic Seasonal Sea Ice Zone). Samples collected in open lead waters (OW), under-ice waters (UIW) and from the sea ice (ICE) were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy and subsequently by multivariate statistical methods using Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC). Statistical analyses of all measured DOM fluorescence excitation and emission matrices (EEMs) enabled four components to be identified and validated. The spectral characteristics of the first component C1 (ŒªEx/ŒªEm 282(270)/335) corresponded to those of tryptophan. The spectral properties of the other three components corresponded to those of humic-like substances: components two (C2‚ÄØ‚àí‚ÄØŒªEx/ŒªEm 315(252)/395) and three (C3‚ÄØ‚àí‚ÄØŒªEx/ŒªEm 357(258)/446) corresponded to humic-like substances of marine origin, whereas component four (C4‚ÄØ‚àí‚ÄØŒªEx/ŒªEm 261(399)/492) resembled terrestrial humic-like substances. Changes in FDOM composition were recorded in OW, in contrast to UIW and sea ice. In the OW the sum of fluorescence intensities of humic-like components (C2, C3 and C4) was two times higher than the fluorescence intensity of protein-like component (C1). Component C2 exhibited the highest fluorescence intensity. In the UIW and particularly in the sea ice the fluorescence intensity of the protein-like component, IC1, was the highest. The IC1 in the sea ice increased toward the sea ice bottom, reaching maximum values at the sea ice-water interface. The calculated spectral indices (SUVA(254) and HIX) and ratios of fluorescence intensities of protein-like to humic-like components, Ip/Ih, suggested that FDOM in water and sea ice was predominantly autochthonous, characterized by low molecular weight organic compounds and low aromatic ring saturation. Enrichment factors Dc, calculated from salinity-normalized values of the optical DOM properties and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, indicated the significant fractionation of FDOM in the sea ice relative to the parent open waters. The humic-like terrestrial component C4 was enriched the least, whereas the protein-like component C1 was enriched the most. A statistically significant (p‚ÄØ{\textless}‚ÄØ0.0001) and relatively strong (R‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ63) correlation between IC1 and the total chlorophyll a concentration Tchla was found in the sea ice, which suggests that sympagic algal communities were producers of the protein-like FDOM fraction.},

A method is described, allied to the carbon-14 method for measuring photosynthesis, whereby the heterotrophic uptake of any chosen substrate in sea water can be measured using the substrate labelled by carbon-14. The method is rapid and convenient and can give values of ‚Äòrelative-heterotrophic potential‚Äô. As with the radiochemical method for measuring marine photosynthesis, the exact interpretation of results presents many problems but the technique should prove a useful exploratory tool. Tests have been made using fully labelled acetate and glucose. By a method of progressive radio-isotopic dilution it is possible to measure either the concentration or organic substrate in sea water or obtain information of the enzyme kinetics of the microorganisms assimilating a given substrate. A description is given of this method. A few preliminary trials to test its applicability have been encouraging.},

No apparent correlation existed between primary production and the level of dissolved carbon in the euphotic zone. Deep water masses were characterized by temperature-salinity relationships and by the concentration of carbon. Calculations for the mixing of these water masses of differing origin on the basis of salinity, corresponded with similar calculations based on carbon. Assuming 90\% conversion of total particulate organic matter to carbon dioxide by grazing organisms a minimum of 260 years is required to produce the amount of organic carbon present in the Arabian Sea. The conclusion is reached that carbon in solution and in particulate form in the ocean is extremely stable and subject to limited change by biological action.},

	abstract = {The ocean is a major global reservoir of organic matter. Photosynthetic microalgae and bacteria are the major sources of organic matter in the ocean, and it is estimated that 45\% (0.5 √ó 1017 g C year‚àí1) of global primary production occurs in the euphotic zone of the ocean (Hedges 1992). The contribution of organic matter from the continents to the ocean is {\textasciitilde}100-fold lower than the input from marine primary production. Rivers discharge 0.4 √ó 1015 g C annually to the ocean, and aeolian transport contributes another 0.1 √ó 1015 g C annually (Hedges 1992). About 8 √ó 1017 g C resides in ocean waters and surface sediments (Hedges 1992), and, given the above mentioned annual fluxes, a mean residence time of 16 years is calculated for organic carbon in the ocean. This relatively short mean residence time indicates that most organic matter cycles rapidly in the ocean. In contrast, however, the average 14C ‚Äúage‚Äù of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the deep ocean is 4000‚Äì6000 years B.P. (Williams and Druffel 1987; Bauer et al. 1992), indicating that some organic matter has a long residence time in the ocean. These apparently contradictory observations indicate that residence times of the diverse mixture of organic molecules in seawater are highly variable. This chapter will review various aspects of the marine carbon cycle and provide new insights into the composition and transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean.},

These isolates represented 22 to 33 percent of the total DOM and included essentially all colloidal material. The elemental, carbohydrate, and carbon-type (by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance) compositions of the isolates indicated that the relative abundance of polysaccharides was high (‚àº50 percent) in surface water and decreased to ‚àº25 percent in deeper samples.

The water residence times based on Ra isotopes were approximately 15 (¬±7) for GB and 1‚Äì3 days for SB and UB. UB and SB showed clear two (terrestrial and marine) endmember mixing trends for DOC, DIN, and DIP. In addition, significant ‚Äúexcess‚Äù DOC (10‚Äì50\% of outer bay) was observed for SB under depleted nutrient conditions. GB, which had the longest water-residence time, showed depleted DIN and DIP, with large ‚Äúexcess‚Äù DOC (40‚Äì60\% of the outer bay) and DON (10‚Äì40\% of the outer bay) concentrations. The excess DOC observed in SB and GB was found to be marine in origin, although there was a slight influence of terrestrial DOC in the low-salinity waters of SB based on Œ¥13C-DOC values. Terrestrial humic-like FDOM was conservatively mixed in the three bays. The net fluxes of these components, estimated using the water residence times, suggest that GB is a significant source of DOM (DOC, DON, and humic FDOM) but a sink of DIN and DIP. SB and UB are the sources of inorganic nutrients as well as DOM to the open ocean. Therefore, our study reveals that the residence time of coastal embayment play an important role in the biogeochemical production and alteration of nutrients and DOM.},

	abstract = {The spatial and seasonal variations of methane-derived carbon contributions to Chironomus plumosus larvae and oligochaetes biomass at four stations in a polymictic, eutrophic lake were examined to determine which factors (CH4 and/or dissolved oxygen) affect the methane-derived carbon contributions, and quantify impacts of benthic methane-derived carbon on the lake food web. Methane-derived carbon contributions were estimated by a two-source mixing model using Œ¥13C values of monthly particulate organic matter ( ‚àí29.5 to ‚àí20.8‚Ä∞) and methane-oxidizing bacteria (‚àí85.7‚Ä∞). Large spatial and seasonal variability of methane-derived carbon contributions to C. plumosus and oligochaetes within the lake (0‚Äì38\% and 0‚Äì32\%, respectively) were observed, where contributions varied spatially along a gradient of sediment CH4 concentration, but not dissolved oxygen. The results suggest that for both C. plumosus and oligochaetes, spatial variabilities of the methane-derived carbon contributions are regulated by CH4. Seasonal variability of methane-derived carbon contributions to C. plumosus revealed increases in summer and autumn following increases in CH4. Methane-derived biomass (methane-derived carbon\% √ó biomass) of C. plumosus were also higher in summer and autumn, suggesting transfer of methane-derived carbon to higher trophic organisms may be larger during those seasons, and limited in winter and spring. Although oligochaetes did not show seasonal variability of methane-derived carbon contributions, they provided a consistent source of methane-derived biomass to higher trophic levels throughout the year. Our study demonstrates that two major macroinvertebrates complementarily contribute to fueling methane-derived carbon cycling through trophic transfer in a polymictic lake.},

	abstract = {The Arctic Ocean is considerably affected by the consequences of global warming, including more extreme seasonal fluctuations in the physical environment. So far, little is known about seasonality in Arctic marine ecosystems in particular microbial dynamics and cycling of organic matter. The limited characterization can be partially attributed to logistic difficulties of sampling in the Arctic Ocean beyond the summer season. Here, we investigated the distribution and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM), gel particles and heterotrophic bacterial activity in the Fram Strait during summer and autumn. Our results revealed that phytoplankton biomass influenced the concentration and composition of semi-labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which strongly decreased from summer to autumn. The seasonal decrease in bioavailability of DOM appeared to be the dominant control on bacterial abundance and activity, while no temperature effect was determined. Additionally, there were clear differences in transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and Coomassie Blue stainable particles (CSP) dynamics. The amount of TEP and CSP decreased from summer to autumn, but CSP was relatively enriched in both seasons. Our study therewith indicates clear seasonal differences in the microbial cycling of organic matter in the Fram Strait. Our data may help to establish baseline knowledge about seasonal changes in microbial ecosystem dynamics to better assess the impact of environmental change in the warming Arctic Ocean.

	abstract = {Marine particulate organic matter (POM) supports the vertical transport of organics in the oceans, and the ecology of microbes and filter feeders. POM is collected on GFF filters and quantified as particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON). The filtrate contains dissolved organic matter (DOM) that partly is abiotically converted into POM and can be collected on 10 GFF filters. We filtered seawater from cultures and the pelagic ocean, after the initial sample filtration yielding the conventional POC/PON sample (POM1), we refiltered the filtrate yielding POM2, refiltering its filtrate we obtained POM3 and so on till POMi. Refiltered POM tended to the same concentration independent of the sample depth and even after a few refiltrations, independent of the original particulate organic load. POM2/POMi for surface water ({\textless}100m) was about 0.1 and for deep water ({\textgreater}1000m) was {\textgreater}1.0. We considered adsorption of DOM and bacteria that had passed through the first filter but 15 concluded that these could not explain the high POM concentration in the filtrates. We suggest that POM in filtrates represent gels formed due to hydraulic stress during filtration. The ratio of POM2/POMi will partly depend on environmental conditions like turbulent energy. We suggest that the increase of POM2/POMi with depth is related to the lower in situ turbulent energy at greater depth. We discuss aspects of POM methodology, including problems with acidification of samples, and the wider ecological implications of our results.},

This synergy was greatly enhanced by research funded under the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI), a 10-year enterprise that allowed unprecedented collection of observations and data products, novel experiments, and international collaborations that focused on the Gulf of Mexico, but resulted in the generation of scientific findings and tools of broader value. Operational oil spill modeling greatly benefited from research during the GoMRI decade. This paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of the related scientific advances, remaining challenges, and future outlook. Two main modeling components are discussed: Ocean circulation and oil spill models, to provide details on all attributes that contribute to the success and limitations of the integrated oil spill forecasts. These forecasts are discussed in tandem with uncertainty factors and methods to mitigate them.

	abstract = {Rationale Anthropogenic organic inputs to freshwaters can exert detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems, raising growing concern for both environmental conservation and water security. Current regulation by the EU water framework directive (European Union, 2000/60/EC) relates to organic pollution by monitoring selected micropollutants; however, aquatic ecosystem responses require a comprehensive understanding of dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition. The introduction of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is set to greatly increase our understanding of the composition of DOM of both natural and anthropogenic origin derived from diffuse and point sources. Methods DOM was extracted from riverine and treated sewage effluent using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analysed using dissolved organic carbon analysis, direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry (DI-HRMS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/HRMS. The data obtained were analysed using univariate and multivariate statistics to demonstrate differences in background DOM, anthropogenic inputs and in-river mixing. Compound identifications were achieved based on MS2 spectra searched against on-line databases. Results DI-HRMS spectra showed the highly complex nature of all DOM SPE extracts. Classification and visualisation of extracts containing many thousands of individual compounds were achieved using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis. Kruskal-Wallis analyses highlighted significant discriminating ions originating from the sewage treatment works for more in-depth investigation by HPLC/HRMS. The generation of MS2 spectra in HPLC/HRMS provided the basis for identification of anthropogenic compounds including; pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, metabolites and oligomers, although many thousands of compounds remain unidentified. Conclusions This new approach enables comprehensive analysis of DOM in extracts without any preconceived ideas of the compounds which may be present. This approach has the potential to be used as a high throughput, qualitative, screening method to determine if the composition of point sources differs from that of the receiving water bodies, providing a new approach to the identification of hitherto unrecognised organic contribution to water bodies.},

Carbon content, stable carbon isotopes, and lipid composition were measured for each DOM fraction, and particles collected in parallel. Lipids, excluding hydrocarbons, comprised up to 0.33\% of HDOM organic carbon, 1.6\% of VHDOM carbon, and 10\% of POC, the majority of which were fatty acids. Although lipids comprised a small fraction of HDOM, fatty acids and sterols provided valuable information on the origins of DOM. Molecular composition of particulate and dissolved lipids and bulk stable carbon isotopes demonstrated differences in organic sources along the estuarine gradient with distinct terrestrial signals in the river and turbid middle estuary and an algal signal in the lower estuary and coastal ocean. Both particulate organic matter and VHDOM samples were enriched in lipids on a carbon basis compared to the HDOM fraction, which suggests that the HDOM fraction was less labile than particulate organic matter or VHDOM. Selective degradation of labile lipids by the microbial community can account for the depletions of unsaturated fatty acids, sterols, and phytol within HDOM relative to particles.},

These dual effects of DOM generate a unimodal relationship in pelagic primary production and primary producer biomass among lakes over a gradient of DOM concentration. However, the responses of benthic algae to variation in DOM loading are less clear because of their potential to access sediment nutrients. We tested algal production and nutrient limitation along a DOM gradient in northern Sweden. Without added nutrients, benthic algal production showed a unimodal relationship with DOM, similar to reported pelagic responses. Nutrient addition revealed widespread nitrogen limitation, with decreasing severity in lakes with higher DOM. Because the majority of northern Swedish lakes currently fall below the inflection point in this unimodal relationship, moderate increases in DOM have the potential to increase benthic primary production, particularly for epilithic algae.},

We here describe the physical and geochemical setting and the predominant microbiological processes in several fjords. Physiological studies of sediments and pure cultures show how the predominantly psychrophilic bacteria are adapted to the near-zero temperature. The microbial communities include bacteria responsible for organic matter hydrolytic degradation, fermentation, and terminal oxidation to CO2. These processes drive the cycling of carbon, sulfur, iron, and manganese. The balance between the dominant sediment microbial processes changes along transects out through the fjords, reflecting the varying impact of the glacier-derived rock flour, rich in metal oxides at the head, and the plankton-derived, labile, marine organic matter at the mouth. Due to accelerated warming of Arctic ecosystems, glaciers are retreating with impacts on the physical, chemical, and biological functioning of the fjord sediment ecosystems.},

In this context marine algae have recently been described as a possible source of CH4 in surface waters. In the present study we investigated the effects of temperature and light intensity (including daylength) on CH4 formation from three widespread marine algal species Emiliania huxleyi, Phaeocystis globosa and Chrysochromulina sp.. Rates of E. huxleyi increased by 210 \% when temperature increased in a range from 10 to 21.5 ¬∞C, while a further increase in temperature (up to 23.8 ¬∞C) showed reduction of CH4 production rates. Our results clearly showed that CH4 formation of E. huxleyi is controlled by light: when light intensity increased from 30 to 2670 Œºmol m-2 s-1 CH4 emission rates increased continuously by almost one order of magnitude and was more than one order of magnitude higher when the daylength (light period) was extended from 6/18 h light-dark cycle to continuous light. Furthermore, light intensity is also an important factor controlling CH4 emissions of Chrysochromulina sp. and P. globosa and could therefore be a species-independent regulator of phytoplankton CH4 production. Based on our results, we might conclude that extensive blooms of E. huxleyi could act as a main regional source of CH4 in surface water, since blooming of E. huxleyi is related to the seasonal increase in both light and temperature, which also stimulate CH4 production. Under typical global change scenarios E. huxleyi will increase its CH4 production in the future.},

	abstract = {Arctic Ocean sediments contain large amounts of methane in the form of free gas and gas hydrate. This highly dynamic methane reservoir is susceptible to be modified by bottom water warming. The warming may lead to gas hydrate destabilization releasing elevated methane fluxes to the seafloor and seawater. Reconstructing past methane dynamics can be achieved by using specific proxies left in the geological record. In this study, we apply a multi-proxy approach for paleo seepage reconstruction from sediment records at gas hydrate mounds (GHMs) in Storfjordrenna (south of the Svalbard archipelago). These shallow water (‚àº380¬†m water depth) systems are potentially vulnerable to global warming related temperature changes. 14C dating of foraminifera shells indicated an onset of deglaciation in the Storfjordrenna region at ‚àº20 kyr BP and allowed us to establish a stratigraphic context based on sediment Zr/Rb and Fe/Ca ratios. Several major (between 15 and 17 kyr BP) and minor methane venting phases were identified and interpreted to be related to gas hydrate instability triggered by isostatic adjustment right after the onset of the deglaciation. The detection of all major methane releases was only possible by combining data sets of stable carbon isotope compositions of foraminifera, mineralogy and Œ¥13C values of authigenic carbonates, and abundance and stable carbon isotope signatures of lipid biomarkers. The most robust single proxy in this study was provided by the Œ¥13C values of archaeal biomarkers. In contrast, the sediment Ba/Ti ratios recorded only the major events. Our results highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of methane dynamics in a small area of some hundred meters across.},

Through both decomposition and production of organic matter, bacteria link multiple biogeochemical cycles together. While there has been a significant amount of work done on understanding the role of microbes in the aquatic carbon cycle, important linkages with other biogeochemical cycles will require more information about how organic matter transformations impact other nutrients, such as phosphorus. In this study, we conducted a culture-based laboratory experiment to examine the production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by heterotrophic bacteria under varied nutrient conditions. In addition to quantifying the production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), we also measured the production of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and characterized the microbially produced organic matter using optical properties. Results demonstrated that measurable amounts of DOC and DOP were produced by heterotrophic bacteria under nutrient regimes ranging from carbon-limitation to strong phosphorus-limitation. Additionally, optical characterization of DOM revealed that the organic matter produced by bacteria grown under high phosphorus conditions was highly aromatic with similar optical properties to terrestrially derived organic matter. Overall, these findings suggest that heterotrophic bacteria can be important producers of organic matter in freshwaters and that continued trends of increased nutrient concentrations (eutrophication) may fundamentally change the composition of microbially produced organic matter in freshwater systems.},

While the chemical structure of many compounds in the Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) remains largely unknown, the high structural diversity has been described at the molecular level using chemical formulas. In this study, we further push the boundaries of TIMS-FT-ICR MS by performing chemical formula-based ion mobility and tandem MS analysis for the structural characterization of DOM. The workflow described is capable to mobility select (R {\textasciitilde}100) and isolate molecular ion signals (ÔÅÑm/z = 0.036) in the ICR cell, using single shot ejections after broadband ejections and MS/MS based on sustained off-resonance irradiation collision-induced dissociation (SORI-CID). The workflow results are compared to alternative TIMS-q-FT-ICR MS/MS experiments with quadrupole isolation at nominal mass ({\textasciitilde}1Da). The technology is demonstrated with isomeric and isobaric mixtures (e.g., 4-Methoxy-1-naphthoic acid, 2-Methoxy-1-naphthoic acid, Decanedioic acid) and applied to the characterization of DOM. The application of this new methodology to the analysis of a DOM is illustrated by the isolation of the molecular ion [C18H18O10-H]- in the presence of other isobars at nominal mass 393. Five IMS bands were assigned to the heterogenous ion mobility profile of [C18H18O10-H]- and candidate structures from the PubChem database were screened based on their ion mobility and MS/MS matching score. This approach overcomes traditional challenges associated with the similarity of fragmentation patterns of DOM samples (e.g., common neutral losses of H2O, CO2, and CH2-H2O) by narrowing down the isomeric candidate structures using the mobility domain.},

	abstract = {The pool of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the deep ocean represents one of the largest carbon sinks on the planet. In recent years, studies have shown that most of this pool is recalcitrant, because individual compounds are present at low concentrations and because certain compounds seem resistant to microbial degradation. The formation of the diverse and recalcitrant deep ocean DOM pool has been attributed to repeated and successive processing of DOM by microorganisms over time scales of weeks to years. Little is known however, about the transformation and cycling that labile DOM undergoes in the first hours upon its release from phytoplankton. Here we provide direct experimental evidence showing that within hours of labile DOM release, its breakdown and recombination with ambient DOM leads to the formation of a diverse array of new molecules in oligotrophic North Atlantic surface waters. Furthermore, our results reveal a preferential breakdown of N and P containing molecules versus those containing only carbon. Hence, we show the preferential breakdown and molecular diversification are the crucial first steps in the eventual formation of carbon rich DOM that is resistant to microbial remineralization.},

	abstract = {Advances in the ultra-high-resolution mass spectroscopy lead to a deep insight into the molecular characterization of natural organic matter (NOM). Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) has been used as one of the most powerful tools to decipher NOM molecules. In FTICR-MS analysis, the matrix effects caused by the co-occurring inorganic substances in water samples greatly affect the ionization of NOM molecules. The inherent complexity of NOM may hinder its component classification and formula assignment. In this study, basic principles and recent advances for sample separation and purification approaches, ionization methods, and the evolutions in formula assignment and data exploitation of the FTICR-MS analysis were reviewed. The complementary characterization methods for FTICR-MS were also reviewed. By coupling with other developed/developing characterization methods, the statistical confidence for inferring the NOM compositions by FTICR-MS was greatly improved. Despite that the refined separation procedures and advanced data processing methods for NOM molecules have been exploited, the big challenge for interpreting NOM molecules is to give the basic structures of them. Online share of the FTICR-MS data, further optimizing the FTICR-MS technique, and coupling this technique with more characterization methods would be beneficial to improving the understanding of the composition and property of NOM.},

The seeping methane dissolves and supports the growth of aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB), but the effect of seepage and seep related biogeochemical processes on water column dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics is not well constrained. We compared dissolved methane, nutrients, chlorophyll, and particulate matter concentrations and methane oxidation (MOx) rates from previously characterized seep and non-seep areas at the continental margin of Svalbard and the Barents Sea in May and June 2017. DOM molecular composition was determined by Electrospray Ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). We found that the chemical diversity of DOM was 3 to 5 \% higher and constituted more protein- and lipid-like composition near methane seeps when compared to non-seep areas. Distributions of nutrients, chlorophyll, and particulate matter however, were essentially governed by the water column hydrography and primary production. We surmise that the organic intermediates directly derived from seepage or indirectly from seep-related biogeochemical processes, e.g. MOx, modifies the composition of DOM leading to distinct DOM molecular-level signatures in the water column at cold seeps.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial hydrology is central to the Arctic system and its freshwater circulation. Water transport and water constituents vary, however, across a very diverse geography. In this paper, which is a component of the Arctic Freshwater Synthesis, we review the central freshwater processes in the terrestrial Arctic drainage and how they function and change across seven hydrophysiographical regions (Arctic tundra, boreal plains, shield, mountains, grasslands, glaciers/ice caps, and wetlands). We also highlight links between terrestrial hydrology and other components of the Arctic freshwater system. In terms of key processes, snow cover extent and duration is generally decreasing on a pan-Arctic scale, but snow depth is likely to increase in the Arctic tundra. Evapotranspiration will likely increase overall, but as it is coupled to shifts in landscape characteristics, regional changes are uncertain and may vary over time. Streamflow will generally increase with increasing precipitation, but high and low flows may decrease in some regions. Continued permafrost thaw will trigger hydrological change in multiple ways, particularly through increasing connectivity between groundwater and surface water and changing water storage in lakes and soils, which will influence exchange of moisture with the atmosphere. Other effects of hydrological change include increased risks to infrastructure and water resource planning, ecosystem shifts, and growing flows of water, nutrients, sediment, and carbon to the ocean. Coordinated efforts in monitoring, modeling, and processing studies at various scales are required to improve the understanding of change, in particular at the interfaces between hydrology, atmosphere, ecology, resources, and oceans.},

	abstract = {Climate change is leading to increases in freshwater discharge to coastal environments with implications for benthic community structure and functioning. Freshwater inputs create strong environmental gradients, which potentially affect the community structure of benthic infauna. In turn, changes in functional trait composition have the potential to affect the processing of terrestrially-derived nutrients and organic matter along the freshwater to marine continuum. We investigated the effects of riverine inputs on benthic community structure, functional traits, taxonomic and functional diversity, and utilization of terrestrial organic matter in two contrasting northern Norwegian fjords. Results of this study revealed extensive impacts of riverine inputs on community structure and functional traits. Communities directly affected by the river were characterized by diminished taxonomic and functional diversity, with species and trait composition indicative of an environment influenced by high sedimentation rates. Large, deep-dwelling, biodiffusors and upward conveyors dominated these communities. High community biomass at the river outlet as well as indications of terrestrial organic matter utilization evidenced by stable isotope analyses, suggest that such river-influenced communities may be important for the cycling of terrestrial carbon and nutrients in the coastal zone.},

Of particular interest are the world's ultraslow spreading ridges that were the last to be demonstrated to host high-temperature venting but may host systems particularly relevant to prebiotic chemistry and the origins of life. Here we report evidence for previously unknown, diverse, and very deep hydrothermal vents along the approximately 110 km long, ultraslow spreading Mid-Cayman Rise (MCR). Our data indicate that the MCR hosts at least three discrete hydrothermal sites, each representing a different type of water-rock interaction, including both mafic and ultramafic systems and, at approximately 5,000 m, the deepest known hydrothermal vent. Although submarine hydrothermal circulation, in which seawater percolates through and reacts with host lithologies, occurs on all mid-ocean ridges, the diversity of vent types identified here and their relative geographic isolation make the MCR unique in the oceans. These new sites offer prospects for an expanded range of vent-fluid compositions, varieties of abiotic organic chemical synthesis and extremophile microorganisms, and unparalleled faunal biodiversity--all in close proximity.},

Different from published approaches, we offer diagnostic and validation tools for all relevant steps. Among other features, we included objective and reproducible reduction of noise and systematic errors, spectra recalibration and alignment, and identification of likeliest molecular formulas. With 15 chemical elements, the tool offers high flexibility in formula attribution. Alignment of mass spectra among different samples prior to molecular formula assignment improves mass error and facilitates molecular formula confirmation with the help of isotopologues.

	abstract = {Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an ultracomplex mixture that is essential to global carbon cycling but is poorly understood because of its complexity. The most powerful tool for the DOM characterization is high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) generally combined to direct infusion (DI) as sample introduction. Liquid chromatography (LC) represents a compelling alternative to DI; however, state-of-the-art techniques involve only offline LC-HRMS approaches, which have important logistical drawbacks that make DOM analysis more challenging. This study introduces a new method based on online coupling of liquid chromatography to high resolution mass spectrometry, able to overcome the disadvantages of usual approaches. It is characterized by high reproducibility (\% Bray‚ÄìCurtis dissimilarity among replicates ‚âà 2.5\%), and it reduces transient complexity and contaminant interferences, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), leading to the identification of an overall larger number of formulas in the mixture. Moreover, the application of an in silico fractionation prior to the statistical analysis allows an easy, flexible, fast, and detailed comparison of DOM samples from a variety of sources with a single chromatographic run.},

	abstract = {The decline of sea-ice thickness, area, and volume due to the transition from multi-year to first-year sea ice has improved the under-ice light environment for pelagic Arctic ecosystems. One unexpected and direct consequence of this transition, the proliferation of under-ice phytoplankton blooms (UIBs), challenges the paradigm that waters beneath the ice pack harbor little planktonic life. Little is known about the diversity and spatial distribution of UIBs in the Arctic Ocean, or the environmental drivers behind their timing, magnitude, and taxonomic composition. Here, we compiled a unique and comprehensive dataset from seven major research projects in the Arctic Ocean (11 expeditions, covering the spring sea-ice-covered period to summer ice-free conditions) to identify the environmental drivers responsible for initiating and shaping the magnitude and assemblage structure of UIBs. The temporal dynamics behind UIB formation are related to the ways that snow and sea-ice conditions impact the under-ice light field. In particular, the onset of snowmelt significantly increased under-ice light availability ({\textgreater}0.1‚Äì0.2 mol photons m‚Äì2 d‚Äì1), marking the concomitant termination of the sea-ice algal bloom and initiation of UIBs. At the pan-Arctic scale, bloom magnitude (expressed as maximum chlorophyll a concentration) was predicted best by winter water Si(OH)4 and PO43‚Äì concentrations, as well as Si(OH)4:NO3‚Äì and PO43‚Äì:NO3‚Äì drawdown ratios, but not NO3‚Äì concentration. Two main phytoplankton assemblages dominated UIBs (diatoms or Phaeocystis), driven primarily by the winter nitrate:silicate (NO3‚Äì:Si(OH)4) ratio and the under-ice light climate. Phaeocystis co-dominated in low Si(OH)4 (i.e., NO3:Si(OH)4 molar ratios {\textgreater}1) waters, while diatoms contributed the bulk of UIB biomass when Si(OH)4 was high (i.e., NO3:Si(OH)4 molar ratios {\textless}1). The implications of such differences in UIB composition could have important ramifications for Arctic biogeochemical cycles, and ultimately impact carbon flow to higher trophic levels and the deep ocean.},

Traditional oligonucleotide probes targeting 16S rRNAs of type I (MG84/705 probe) and type II (MA450 probe) methanotrophs were labeled with fluorescein or Alexa fluor and used for FISH, followed by fluorescence-activated FC analysis and cell sorting (FACS). The method resulted in efficient separation of target cells (type I or type II methanotrophs) from the artificial mixtures. The method was then applied for detection and enrichment of type I and type II methanotroph populations from a natural sample, Lake Washington sediment. Cells were extracted from the sediment, fixed, and subjected to FISH/FC/FACS. The resulting subpopulations were analyzed by reverse transcriptase PCR surveys of 16S rRNA, pmoA (encoding a subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase), and fae (encoding formaldehyde-activating enzyme) genes. The functional gene analysis indicated specific separation of the type I and type II methanotroph populations. 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that type I methanotrophs comprised 59\% of the subpopulation separated using the type I-specific probe and that type II methanotrophs comprised 47.5\% of the subpopulation separated using the type II-specific probe. Our data indicate that the FISH/FC/FACS protocol described can provide significant enrichment of microbial populations of interest from complex natural communities and that these can be used for genetic tests. We further tested the possibility of direct whole-genome amplification (WGA) from limited numbers of sorted cells, using artificial mixtures of microbes whose genome sequences are known. We demonstrated that efficient WGA can be achieved using 104 or more cells separated by 16S rRNA-specific FISH/FC/FACS, while fewer cells resulted in less specific WGA.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The circulation and water mass properties in the Eurasian Basin are discussed based on a review of previous research and an examination of observations made in recent years within, or parallel to, DAMOCLES (Developing Arctic Modeling and Observational Capabilities for Long-term Environmental Studies). The discussion is strongly biased towards observations made from icebreakers and particularly from the cruise with R/V Polarstern 2007 during the International Polar Year (IPY). Focus is on the Barents Sea inflow branch and its mixing with the Fram Strait inflow branch. It is proposed that the Barents Sea branch contributes not just intermediate water but also most of the water to the Atlantic layer in the Amundsen Basin and also in the Makarov and Canada basins. Only occasionally would high temperature pulses originating from the Fram Strait branch penetrate along the Laptev Sea slope across the Gakkel Ridge into the Amundsen Basin. Interactions between the Barents Sea and the Fram Strait branches lead to formation of intrusive layers, in the Atlantic layer and in the intermediate waters. The intrusion characteristics found downstream, north of the Laptev Sea are similar to those observed in the northern Nansen Basin and over the Gakkel Ridge, suggesting a flow from the Laptev Sea towards Fram Strait. The formation mechanisms for the intrusions at the continental slope, or in the interior of the basins if they are reformed there, have not been identified. The temperature of the deep water of the Eurasian Basin has increased in the last 10 yr rather more than expected from geothermal heating. That geothermal heating does influence the deep water column was obvious from 2007 Polarstern observations made close to a hydrothermal vent in the Gakkel Ridge, where the temperature minimum usually found above the 600‚Äì800 m thick homogenous bottom layer was absent. However, heat entrained from the Atlantic water into descending, saline boundary plumes may also contribute to the warming of the deeper layers.},

Here we present Œ¥30Si-DSi and Œ¥30Si of biogenic silica (Œ¥30Si-bSiO2) in the intermediate to deep waters of the Central Arctic Ocean (AO) aiming at investigating in more detail the relative influence of water mass mixing and particle flux on the Si cycle in the AO. Comparing the Œ¥30Si-DSi with the water mass composition derived from Optimum Multiparameter analysis, we were able to test the influence of the water masses in the Œ¥30Si-DSi distribution. We were able to show the dominant Atlantic Water (AW) influence at the stations close to the Fram Strait (station 32 and 40, Œ¥30Si-DSi = 1.51 ¬± 0.11‚Ä∞, 2SEM, n=3) and the only small Œ¥30Si-DSi modification when compared to the endmember value from a previous study (Œ¥30Si-DSi = 1.55‚Ä∞). The Dense Arctic Atlantic Water, dominating from 200 to 500 m water depth (except for stations 32 and 40, where it was present only at 500 m), was marked by heavier Œ¥30Si-DSi of 1.62 ¬± 0.06‚Ä∞ (2SEM, n=21). This is probably due to the influence of entraining equally dense water from the shelves. Due to productivity and Si utilization on the shelves, both water and bSiO2, that were transported laterally into the Central AO, were characterized by higher Œ¥30Si, with Œ¥30Si-bSiO2 of 1.64 ¬± 0.13‚Ä∞ (2SEM, n=7). Particle dissolution at greater depths did not play a major role in the Œ¥30Si-DSi of deep waters due to the low bSiO2 concentrations at these greater depths. Outflowing water masses from the AO present different Œ¥30Si-DSi, with lower values around 1.46‚Ä∞ originating from the Central AO influencing predominantly DSOW and ISOW, and higher values around 2‚Ä∞ originating from the Canadian AO influencing predominantly LSW. Those signatures correspond with the Œ¥30Si-DSi found in the North Atlantic. Consequently, the AO potentially presents several isotopically different endmembers that contribute to the deep water formed in the North Atlantic.},

In a region that still experiences nearly complete ice cover throughout the year, export fluxes of total particulate matter (TPM), particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate nitrogen (PN), biogenic matter, lithogenic matter, biogenic particulate silica (bPSi), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), protists and biomarkers only slightly decreased with depth. Seasonal variations of particulate matter fluxes were similar on both sides of the Gakkel Ridge. Somewhat higher export rates in the Amundsen Basin and differences in the composition of the sinking TPM and bPSi on each side of the Gakkel Ridge probably reflected the influence of the Lena River/Transpolar Drift in the Amundsen Basin and the influence of Atlantic water in the Nansen Basin. Low variations in particle export with depth revealed a limited influence of lateral advection in the deep barren Eurasian Basin.This article is part of the theme issue ‚ÄòThe changing Arctic Ocean: consequences for biological communities, biogeochemical processes and ecosystem functioning‚Äô.},

The southern channel is characterized by smooth and flat bathymetry around 1600‚Äì1700\&thinsp;m with a sill depth slightly shallower than 1700\&thinsp;m. A hydrographic section across the channel reveals an eastward flow with Amundsen Basin properties in the southern part and a westward flow of Makarov Basin properties in the northern part. The northern passage includes an approximately 72\&thinsp;km long and 33\&thinsp;km wide trough which forms an intra-basin in the Lomonosov Ridge morphology (the Oden Trough). The eastern side of the Oden Trough is enclosed by a narrow and steep ridge rising 500‚Äì600\&thinsp;m above a generally 1600\&thinsp;m deep trough bottom. The deepest passage (the sill) is 1470\&thinsp;m deep and located on this ridge. Hydrographic data show irregular temperature and salinity profiles indicating that water exchange occurs as midwater intrusions bringing water properties from each side of the ridge in well-defined but irregular layers. There is also morphological evidence that some rather energetic flows may occur in the vicinity of the sill. A well expressed deepening near the sill may be the result of seabed erosion by bottom currents.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {As consequences of global warming sea-ice shrinking, permafrost thawing and changes in fresh water and terrestrial material export have already been reported in the Arctic environment. These processes impact light penetration and primary production. To reach a better understanding of the current status and to provide accurate forecasts Arctic biogeochemical and physical parameters need to be extensively monitored. In this sense, bio-optical properties are useful to be measured due to the applicability of optical instrumentation to autonomous platforms, including satellites. This study characterizes the non-water absorbers and their coupling to hydrographic conditions in the poorly sampled surface waters of the central and eastern Arctic Ocean. Over the entire sampled area colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dominates the light absorption in surface waters. The distribution of CDOM, phytoplankton and non-algal particles absorption reproduces the hydrographic variability in this region of the Arctic Ocean which suggests a subdivision into five major bio-optical provinces: Laptev Sea Shelf, Laptev Sea, Central Arctic/Transpolar Drift, Beaufort Gyre and Eurasian/Nansen Basin. Evaluating ocean color algorithms commonly applied in the Arctic Ocean shows that global and regionally tuned empirical algorithms provide poor chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) estimates. The semi-analytical algorithms Generalized Inherent Optical Property model (GIOP) and Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM), on the other hand, provide robust estimates of Chl-a and absorption of colored matter. Applying GSM with modifications proposed for the western Arctic Ocean produced reliable information on the absorption by colored matter, and specifically by CDOM. These findings highlight that only semi-analytical ocean color algorithms are able to identify with low uncertainty the distribution of the different optical water constituents in these high CDOM absorbing waters. In addition, a clustering of the Arctic Ocean into bio-optical provinces will help to develop and then select province-specific ocean color algorithms.},

	abstract = {The Arctic Ocean subseabed holds vast reservoirs of the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4), often seeping into the ocean water column. In a continuously warming ocean as a result of climate change an increase of CH4 seepage from the seabed is hypothesized. Today, CH4 is largely retained in the water column due to the activity of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) that thrive there. Predicted future oceanographic changes, bottom water warming and increasing CH4 release may alter efficacy of this microbially mediated CH4 sink. Here we investigate the composition and principle controls on abundance and activity of the MOB communities at the shallow continental shelf west of Svalbard, which is subject to strong seasonal changes in oceanographic conditions. Covering a large area (364 km2), we measured vertical distribution of microbial methane oxidation (MOx) rates, MOB community composition, dissolved CH4 concentrations, temperature and salinity four times throughout spring and summer during three consecutive years. Sequencing analyses of the pmoA gene revealed a small, relatively uniform community mainly composed of type-Ia methanotrophs (deep-sea 3 clade). We found highest MOx rates (7 nM d‚àí1) in summer in bathymetric depressions filled with stagnant Atlantic Water containing moderate concentrations of dissolved CH4 ({\textless} 100 nM). MOx rates in these depressions during spring were much lower ({\textless} 0.5 nM d‚àí1) due to lower temperatures and mixing of Transformed Atlantic Water flushing MOB with the Atlantic Water out of the depressions. Our results show that MOB and MOx in CH4-rich bottom waters are highly affected by geomorphology and seasonal conditions.},

	abstract = {Seawater circulation in permeable coastal sediments is driven by tidal changes in hydraulic gradients. The resulting submarine groundwater discharge is a source of nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the water column. Yet, little is known about the cycling of DOM within tidal sediments, because the molecular DOM characterization remains analytically challenging. One technique that can dissect the multitude of molecules in DOM is ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). To aim at a high resolution DOM analysis we study the seasonal turnover and marine and terrestrial sources of DOM in an intertidal creek bank of the southern North Sea down to 3m depth and link the biogeochemical processes to FT-ICR-MS data and the analyses of inorganic porewater chemistry, Œ¥13C of solid-phase extracted dissolved organic carbon (SPE-DOC), dissolved black carbon (DBC) and dissolved carbohydrates (DCHO). Increasing concentrations of dissolved Fe, Mn, P, total alkalinity, dissolved nitrogen, DOC and a concomitant decrease of sulfate along the seawater circulation path from the upper tidal flat to the tidal flat margin indicate continuous microbial activity. The relative increase of Si concentrations, unsaturated aliphatics, peptide molecular formulae and isotopically more 13C-enriched SPE-DOC towards the tidal flat margin suggests that remineralization processes mobilize DOM from buried algal (diatoms) and microbial biomass. Porewater in sediments {\textless}100cm depth contains 13C-depleted SPE-DOC and highly unsaturated compounds which are probably derived from eroded peats, suggesting rapid removal of bioavailable marine DOM such as DCHO from the water column and selective enrichment of terrestrial DOM. DBC concentrations are highest in the discharging porewater close to the tidal creek suggesting that the intertidal flat is an important DBC source to the coastal ocean. Porewater DOM accumulating at the low water line is enriched in N and S. We hypothesize that this is partly due to DOM reacting with dissolved sulfide and ammonium which may increase the refractory character of the DOM, hence making it less bioavailable for in situ active microbes.},

	abstract = {van Krevelen diagrams (O/C vs H/C ratios of elemental formulas) have been widely used in studies to obtain an estimation of the main compound categories present in environmental samples. However, the limits defining a specific compound category based solely on O/C and H/C ratios of elemental formulas have never been accurately listed or proposed to classify metabolites in biological samples. Furthermore, while O/C vs H/C ratios of elemental formulas can provide an overview of the compound categories, such classification is inefficient because of the large overlap among different compound categories along both axes. We propose a more accurate compound classification for biological samples analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry based on an assessment of the C/H/O/N/P stoichiometric ratios of over 130‚ÄØ000 elemental formulas of compounds classified in 6 main categories: lipids, peptides, amino sugars, carbohydrates, nucleotides, and phytochemical compounds (oxy-aromatic compounds). Our multidimensional stoichiometric compound classification (MSCC) constraints showed a highly accurate categorization of elemental formulas to the main compound categories in biological samples with over 98\% of accuracy representing a substantial improvement over any classification based on the classic van Krevelen diagram. This method represents a signficant step forward in environmental research, especially ecological stoichiometry and eco-metabolomics studies, by providing a novel and robust tool to improve our understanding of the ecosystem structure and function through the chemical characterization of biological samples.},

	abstract = {The thermohaline circulation of the Arctic Ocean and the Greenland Sea is conditioned by the harsh, high latitude climate and by bathymetry. Warm Atlantic water loses its heat and also becomes less saline by added river run-off. In the Arctic Ocean, this leads to rapid cooling of the surface water and to ice formation. Brine, released by freezing, increases the density of the surface layer, but the ice cover also insulates the ocean and reduces heat loss. This limits density increase, and in the central Arctic Ocean a low salinity surface layer and a permanent ice cover are maintained. Only over the shallow shelves, where the entire water column is cooled to freezing, can dense water form and accumulate to eventually sink down the continental slope into the deep ocean. The part of the Atlantic water which enters the Arctic Ocean is thus separated into a low density surface layer and a denser, deep circulation. These two loops exit through Fram Strait. The waters are partly rehomogenized in the Greenland Sea. The main current is confined to the Greenland continental slope, but polar surface water and ice are injected into the central gyre and create a low density lid, allowing for ice formation in winter. This leads to a density increase sufficient to trigger convection, upwelling and subsequent ice melt. The convection maintains the weak stratification of the gyre and also reinforces the deep circulation loop. As the transformed waters return to the North Atlantic the low-salinity, upper water of the East Greenland Current enters the Labrador Sea and influences the formation of Labrador Sea deep water. The dense loop passes through Denmark Strait and the Faroe-Shetland Channel and sinks to contribute to the North Atlantic deep water. Changes in the forcing conditions might alter the relative strength of the two loops. This could affect the oceanic thermohaline circulation on a global scale},

Many, perhaps most, processes were identiÔ¨Åed already by Nansen, who put his mark on almost all subsequent research in the Arctic. Here we shall revisit some key questions and follow how our understanding has evolved from the early 20th century to present. What questions, if any, can now be regarded as solved and which remain still open? Five different but connected topics will be discussed: (1) The low salinity surface layer and the storage and export of freshwater. (2) The vertical heat transfer from the Atlantic water to sea ice and to the atmosphere. (3) The circulation and mixing of the two Atlantic inÔ¨Çow branches. (4) The formation and circulation of deep and bottom waters in the Arctic Ocean. (5) The exchanges through Fram Strait. Foci will be on the potential effects of increased freshwater input and reduced sea ice export on the freshwater storage and residence time in the Arctic Ocean, on the deep waters of the Makarov Basin, and on the circulation and relative importance of the two inÔ¨Çows, over the Barents Sea and through Fram Strait, for the distribution of heat in the intermediate layers of the Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {In spring 2002, the Swedish icebreaker Oden conducted an extensive oceanographic survey of the East Greenland Current from north of Fram Strait to south of Denmark Strait as a part of the Arctic Ocean 2002 programme to study the Nordic Seas, while RV Knorr of Woods Hole worked in the ice-free parts. The Oden survey concentrated on water mass formation in ice covered water and the interactions between the water of the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas. The CTD observations made on Oden are presented by following the Oden cruise track. They describe all major, and many of the more subtle, mixing processes occurring in the Arctic Mediterranean Sea. In Storfjorden, ice formation and brine rejection had created the highest bottom salinities observed in the last 20 years. The Atlantic Water (AW) entering the Arctic Ocean close to Svalbard was cooled and freshened down to 600 m implying that dense, brine enriched shelf water from the northern Svalbard shelf had convected into the Atlantic core. The upper part of the Atlantic Water was cooled by heat loss to the atmosphere and to ice melt. About 30\% of the heat went to ice melt leading to a less saline upper layer that eventually forms the embryo of the Arctic Ocean halocline water. North of the Yermak Plateau Atlantic Water as well as Arctic Intermediate Water (AIW) and Nordic Seas Deep Water (NDW) were seen to enter the Arctic Ocean. North of 81¬∞N the Arctic Ocean water masses dominated west of 0¬∞E, while recirculating waters from the south were observed first at 79¬∞N. The properties of the intermediate and deep waters exiting the Arctic Ocean in the East Greenland Current changed considerably from Fram Strait to the Greenland Sea indicating interactions with recirculating waters. The salinity of the Polar Surface Water (PSW) increased from Fram Strait to Denmark Strait but the thickness of the low salinity upper layer also increased and the freshwater content appeared to be conserved. The Denmark Strait overflow plume was stratified and several of the different water masses present at the sill in Denmark Strait at the Oden crossing could contribute to the overflow. Arctic Atlantic Water (AAW) and Recirculating Atlantic Water (RAW) as well as Polar Intermediate Water (PIW) would supply the less dense part, while the ultimate origin of densest component of the overflow, found at the Iceland side of the trench, still is an open question. The low salinity lid found on top of the overflow plume in the Irminger Sea suggests that entrainment of ambient water into the overflow plume was small.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) changes in quantity and quality over time and space, especially in highly dynamic coastal estuaries. Bacterioplankton usually display seasonal and spatial variations in abundance and composition in the coastal regions, and influence the DOM pool via assimilation, transformation and release of organic molecules. The change in DOM can also affect the composition of bacterial community. However, little is known on the correspondence between DOM molecules and bacterial composition, particularly through a systematic field survey. In this study, the spatiotemporal signatures of microbial communities and DOM composition in the subtropical coastal estuary of Xiamen are investigated over one and half years. The co-occurrence analysis between bacteria and DOM suggested microorganisms likely transformed the DOM from a relatively high ({\textgreater}400¬†Da) to a low ({\textless}400¬†Da) molecular weight, corresponding to an apparent increase in overall aromaticity. This might be the reason why microbial transformation renders ‚Äúdark‚Äù organic matter visible in mass spectrometry due to more efficient ionization of microbial metabolites, as well as photodegradation processes. K- and r-strategists exhibited different correlations with two-size categories of DOM molecules owing to their different lifestyles and responses to environmental nutrient conditions. A comparison of the environmental variables and DOM composition with the microbial communities showed that the environmental/DOM variations played a more important role in shaping the microbial communities than vice versa. This study sheds light on the interactions between microbial populations and DOM molecules at the spatiotemporal scale, improving our understanding of microbial roles in marine biogeochemical cycles.},

Ongoing technological developments are increasing the quantity and quality of data collected from the deep seafloor. Despite these improvements, the area of seafloor, which towed systems can survey, optically remains limited by the rapid attenuation of visible wavelengths within water. We present an overview of a new towed camera platform integrating additional acoustical devices: the ocean floor observation and bathymetry system (OFOBS). The towed system maintains continuous direct communication via fiber optic cable with a support vessel, operational at depths up to 6000 m. In addition to collecting seafloor photo and video data, OFOBS gathers sidescan data over a 100-m swath width. OFOBS functionality is further augmented by a forward looking sonar, used to aid in hazard avoidance and real-time course correction. Data collected during the first field deployments of OFOBS, at a range of seamounts on the Langseth Ridge/Gakkel Ridge intersection (86¬∞ N, 61¬∞ E) in the high Arctic in September 2016, are presented to demonstrate the functionality of the system. Collected from a location with near continuous ice cover, this explanatory data set highlights the advantages of the system for deep-sea survey work in environments currently difficult to access for the majority of subsurface research platforms.},

	abstract = {The Oden 91 Expedition has provided a data set that makes it possible to deduce more detailed ideas regarding the origin and circulation of waters in the Arctic Ocean. The three possible sources for the deep water of the Arctic Ocean are: (1) density flows down the continental slope triggered by brine enhanced waters formed on the continental shelves but consisting primarily of waters entrained from the Atlantic and intermediate layers; (2) inflow of Atlantic Water over the Barents Sea shelf that has experienced a density increase by cooling and freezing in that sea and then sinks with little entrainment down the St Anna Trough into deep layers of the Arctic Ocean; and (3) the inflow of Norwegian Sea Deep Water through Fram Strait. Of these three sources, the first appears to contribute the most to the Arctic Ocean deep water and the third the least. The Eurasian Basin communicates with the Canadian Basin through a boundary current that enters the Canadian Basin north of Siberia and leaves it north of Greenland. The fact that both the temperature and salinity are higher in the Canadian Basin than in the Eurasian Basin at levels above as well as below the sill depth of the Lomonosov Ridge indicates that slope convection is active in the Canadian Basin. The deepest layers have constant salinity, but show a weak temperature decrease towards the bottom. This suggests that these layers of the Canadian Basin are not primarily renewed by convection down the continental slope but by a spill over of Eurasian Basin Deep Water across the central part of the Lomonosov Ridge. A model which incorporates density flows triggered by high salinity shelf water and water overflowing the Lomonosov Ridge flom the Eurasian Basin is applied to reproduce the observed profiles of the Canadian Basin and to establish the relative importance of these two sources. By incorporation of I4C profiles into the model, estimates of the exchange rates of water in these layers can be made.},

Observations were taken from a twelve-year time series that included monthly sampling of the water column at eight depths. CH4 concentration fluctuated between 1.75 and 100.9 nmol L-1 (or 67.11\% and 3965\% of saturation), with the highest levels at bottom waters, which increase as upwelling evolved. Three kind of CH4 profiles were identified; a classical diffusion-advection distribution, with bottom/surface CH4 concentration ratio {\textgreater} 2, was predominantly observed in ‚àº54\% of the all profiles and attributed to high CH4 production in the sediments during coastal upwelling season (austral spring-summer); a period of higher biological productivity, as well as in hypoxic/anoxic condition. In contrast, relatively homogeneous profiles (CH4 level ratio between bottom and surface depth {\textless}2) was observed about ‚àº46\% of all profiles during periods of extreme vertical mixing (such as winter storms). Furthermore, irregular CH4 profile with superficial peaks occurring between the surface and 15-30 m depth was likely observed. These peaks indicated that local production rates exceed turbulent mixing rates, suggesting a rapid CH4 cycling due to microbial processes on the surface. Despite the fact that strong seasonality was observed in most oceanographic variables, according to favourable and non-favourable upwelling periods, only a weak seasonality was observed in CH4 content and its air-sea flux, the latter ranged from 1.27 to 47.02 ¬µmol m-2 d-1 (mean¬±SD: 10.94¬±7.48). The annual weighted mean CH4 effluxes during upwelling (64\%) and non-upwelling (36\%) periods fluctuated from 1.66 to 6.22 mmol m-2 (mean¬±SD: 3.40¬±1.43), highlighting the importance of the continental shelf under the influence of coastal upwelling as a significant CH4 source toward the atmosphere.},

However, the importance of subglacial upwelling during the early spring season has not been considered yet. We hypothesized that subglacial discharge under sea ice is present in early spring and that its flux is sufficient to increase phytoplankton primary productivity. We evaluated the effects of the submarine discharge on primary production in a seasonally fast-ice covered Svalbard fjord (Billefjorden) influenced by a tidewater outlet glacier in April and May 2019. We found clear evidence for subglacial discharge and upwelling. Although the estimated bottom-water entrainment factor (1.6) and total fluxes were lower than in summer studies, we still observed substantial impact on the fjord ecosystem and primary production at this time of the year. The subglacial discharge leads to a salinity-stratified surface water layer and sea ice formation with low bulk salinity and permeability. The combination of the stratified surface layer, a 2-fold higher under-ice irradiance due to thinner snow cover, and higher N and Si concentrations at the glacier front supported phytoplankton primary production 2 orders of magnitude higher (42.6 mg C m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚àí2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} d{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚àí1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) compared to a marine reference site at the fast-ice edge. Reciprocal transplant experiments showed that nutrient supply increased phytoplankton primary production by approximately 30 \%. The brackish-water sea ice at the glacier front with its low bulk salinity contained a reduced brine volume, limiting the inhabitable brine channel space and nutrient exchange with the underlying seawater compared to full marine sea ice. Microbial and algal communities were substantially different in subglacial-influenced water and sea ice compared to the marine reference site, sharing taxa with the subglacial outflow water. We suggest that with climate change, the retreat of tidewater glaciers in early spring could lead to decreased under-ice phytoplankton primary production. In contrast, sea ice algae production and biomass may become increasingly important, unless sea ice disappears first, in which case spring phytoplankton primary production may increase.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The possibility that deep-sea hydrothermal vents may contain organic compounds produced by abiotic synthesis or by microbial communities living deep beneath the surface has led to numerous studies of the organic composition of vent fluids. Most of these studies have focused on methane and other light hydrocarbons, while the possible occurrence of more complex organic compounds in the fluids has remained largely unstudied. To address this issue, the presence of higher molecular weight organic compounds in deep-sea hydrothermal fluids was assessed at three sites along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that span a range of temperatures (51 to {\textgreater}360¬∞C), fluid compositions, and host-rock lithologies (mafic to ultramafic). Samples were obtained at several sites within the Lucky Strike, Rainbow, and Lost City hydrothermal fields. Three methods were employed to extract organic compounds for analysis, including liquid:liquid extraction, cold trapping on the walls of a coil of titanium tubing, and pumping fluids through cartridges filled with solid phase extraction (SPE) sorbents. The only samples to consistently yield high amounts of extractable organic compounds were the warm (51‚Äì91¬∞C), highly alkaline fluids from Lost City, which contained elevated concentrations of C8, C10, and C12 n-alkanoic acids and, in some cases, trithiolane, hexadecanol, squalene, and cholesterol. Collectively, the C8‚ÄìC12 acids can account for about 15\% of the total dissolved organic carbon in the Lost City fluids. The even-carbon-number predominance of the alkanoic acids indicates a biological origin, but it is unclear whether these compounds are derived from microbial activity occurring within the hydrothermal chimney proximal to the site of fluid discharge or are transported from deeper within the system. Hydrothermal fluids from the Lucky Strike and Rainbow fields were characterized by an overall scarcity of extractable dissolved organic compounds. Trace amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons including phenanthrenes and benzothiophene were the only compounds that could be identified as indigenous components of these fluids. Although hydrocarbons and fatty acids were observed in some samples, those compounds were likely derived from particulate matter or biomass entrained during fluid collection. In addition, extracts of some fluid samples from the Rainbow field were found to contain an unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of organic compounds. This UCM shared some characteristics with organic matter extracted from bottom seawater, suggesting that the organic matter observed in these samples might represent seawater-derived compounds that had persisted, albeit with partial alteration, during circulation through the hydrothermal system. While there is considerable evidence that Rainbow and Lost City vent fluids contain methane and other light hydrocarbons produced through abiotic reduction of inorganic carbon, we found no evidence for more complex organic compounds with an abiotic origin in the same fluids.},

	abstract = {Current measurements within the East Greenland Current during winter 1965 showed that above the continental slope there were large on-shore components of flow, probably representing a westward Ekman transport. The speed did not decrease significantly with depth, indicating that the barotropic mode dominates the flow. Typical current speeds were 10 to 15 cm. sec.‚Åª¬π. The transport of the current during winter exceeds 35 √ó 10‚Å∂ m. 3 sec.‚Åª¬π. This is an order of magnitude greater than previous estimates and, although there may be seasonal fluctuations in the transport, it suggests that the East Greenland Current primarily represents a circulation internal to the Greenland and Norwegian seas, rather than outflow from the central Polar basin. /// Au cours de l'hiver de 1965, des mesures effectu√©es dans le courant du Groenland oriental ont montr√© que sur le talus continental, la circulation comporte d'importantes composantes dirig√©es vers le rivage, ce qui repr√©sente probablement un flux vers l'ouest selon le mouvement d'Ekman. La vitesse ne diminue pas beaucoup avec la profondeur, ce qui indique que le mode barotropique domine la circulation. Les vitesses typiques du courant sont de 10 √† 15 cm/s‚Åª¬π.

	abstract = {To determine the exchanges between the Nordic Seas and the Arctic Ocean through Fram Strait is one of the most important aspects, and one of the major challenges, in describing the circulation in the Arctic Mediterranean Sea. Especially the northward transport of Arctic Intermediate Water (AIW) from the Nordic Seas into the Arctic Ocean is little known. In the two-ship study of the circulation in the Nordic Seas, Arctic Ocean ‚Äì 2002, the Swedish icebreaker Oden operated in the ice-covered areas in and north of Fram Strait and in the western margins of Greenland and Iceland seas, while RV Knorr of Woods Hole worked in the ice free part of the Nordic Seas. Here two hydrographic sections obtained by Oden, augmented by tracer and velocity measurements with Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP), are examined. The first section, reaching from the Svalbard shelf across the Yermak Plateau, covers the region north of Svalbard where inflow to the Arctic Ocean takes place. The second, western, section spans the outflow area extending from west of the Yermak Plateau onto the Greenland shelf. Geostrophic and LADCP derived velocities are both used to estimate the exchanges of water masses between the Nordic Seas and the Arctic Ocean. The geostrophic computations indicate a total flow of 3.6 Sv entering the Arctic on the eastern section. The southward flow on the western section is found to be 5.1Sv. The total inflow to the Arctic Ocean obtained using the LADCP derived velocities is much larger, 13.6Sv, and the southward transport on the western section is 13.7Sv, equal to the northward transport north of Svalbard. Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) originating from a tracer release experiment in the Greenland Sea in 1996 has become a marker for the circulation of AIW. From the geostrophic velocities we obtain 0.5Sv and from the LADCP derived velocities 2.8Sv of AIW flowing into the Arctic. The annual transport of SF6 into the Arctic Ocean derived from geostrophy is 5kg/year, which is of the same magnitude as the observed total annual transport into the North Atlantic, while the LADCP measurements (19kg/year) imply that it is substantially larger. Little SF6 was found on the western section, confirming the dominance of the Arctic Ocean water masses and indicating that the major recirculation in Fram Strait takes place farther to the south.},

	abstract = {Hydrothermal circulation can lead to fluid mixing on any planet with liquid water and a source of heat. Aqueous fluids with differing compositions, especially different oxidation states, are likely to be far from thermodynamic equilibrium when they mix, and provide a source of free energy that can drive organic synthesis from CO2 and H2, and/or supply a source of geochemical energy to chemolithoautotrophic organisms. Results are presented that quantify the potential for organic synthesis during unbuffered fluid mixing in present submarine hydrothermal systems, as well as hypothetical systems that may have existed on the early Earth and Mars. Dissolved hydrogen, present in submarine hydrothermal fluids owing to the high-temperature reduction of H2O as seawater reacts with oceanic crustal rocks, provides the reduction potential and the thermodynamic drive for organic synthesis from CO2 (or bicarbonate) as hydrothermal fluids mix with seawater. The potential for organic synthesis is a strong function of the H2 content of the hydrothermal fluid, which is, in turn, a function of the prevailing oxidation state controlled by the composition of the rock that hosts the hydrothermal system. Hydrothermal fluids with initial oxidation states at or below those set by the fayalite-magnetite-quartz mineral assemblage show the greatest potential for driving organic synthesis. These calculations show that it is thermodynamically possible for 100\% of the carbon in the mixed fluid to be reduced to a mixture of carboxylic acids, alcohols, and ketones in the range 250-50¬∞C as cold seawater mixes with the hydrothermal fluid. As the temperature drops, larger organic molecules are favored, which implies that fluid mixing could drive the geochemical equivalent of a metabolic system. This enormous reduction potential probably drives a large portion of the primary productivity around present seafloor hydrothermal vents and would have been present in hydrothermal systems on the early Earth or Mars. The single largest control on the potential for organic synthesis is the composition of the rock that hosts the hydrothermal system.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, the Arctic Ocean has suffered a substantial decline in sea-ice cover due to global warming. The impacts of these variations on primary productivity, fluxes of dissolved and particulate organic matter (OM) and turnover at the seafloor are still poorly understood. Here we focus on the characteristics and dynamics of the pool of marine dissolved OM (DOM) in surface sediments of the Arctic Ocean. To investigate spatial and temporal variations of DOM in relation to particulate OM input and benthic microbial community parameters, sediment porewater and overlying bottom water were collected from the long-term observatory HAUSGARTEN in June 2013 and 2014. The study area in the Fram Strait, which is partially covered by sea ice, was sampled along a bathymetric transect (1050-5500 m water depth), from east to west (7¬∞0.2' E to 5¬∞17' W), and from south to north (78¬∞37' to 79¬∞43' N). Molecular data on solid phase extracted DOM obtained via Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometric analysis and a suite of bulk chemical parameters were related to benthic biogeochemical data. Our results demonstrate a close coupling between the production and input of OM from the surface ocean to the seafloor, and the concentration and composition of DOC/DOM in the deep sea. Surface porewaters collected in 2013 from shallower stations (‚â§ 1500 m water depth) in the eastern Fram Strait, had a signal of a larger and more recent input of OM (higher concentrations of phytodetritus), associated with higher numbers of molecular formulas, higher abundances of unsaturated aliphatic formulas and N-containing compounds, in concert with higher enzymatic activity, phospholipids, total organic carbon and protein content. In contrast, porewaters collected in 2014 from deeper stations and from the West, were associated with lower OM input, and showed higher abundances of aromatic and oxygen-poor compounds. Higher OM input was also reflected in higher DOC concentrations and fluxes from the sediment into the water column. Our study demonstrates that regional and temporal variations in OM input can quickly translate into changes in the quantity and quality of surface porewater DOM, the latter substantially altered by deep-sea sediment bacteria.},

These tools were used to reveal the origin of POM and DOM and their mechanisms of formation and transformation across the sediment-water interface. Results show that pore waters were much more enriched in DOM and AA (6 to 25 times) than deep waters. Pore waters are thus a source of DOM and AA (e.g., in proteins, peptides) to the sediment-water interface. AA represented 1.4 to 6.6\% of bulk DOC in pore waters and thus most of the DOM compounds diffusing out of the sediments do not contain AA. Estimated AA pore water fluxes were between 32 and 141‚ÄØŒºmol C m‚àí2d‚àí1 with lower values at the downstream locations. The correlations measured between AA concentrations in pore waters and deep waters, the compositional similarities between pore water DOM and deep-water DOM and their relatively altered state (measured with different diagenetic markers) suggest that a large fraction of the DOM released from the pore waters, including some AA-containing compounds, is not rapidly mineralized in the water column. Pore water DOM and deep-water DOM were the two sample types having the most similar composition when 31 parameters were considered. This similarity steadily increases downstream. Local conditions, such as POM inputs, redox conditions, and sediment mineralogy, seem to control the sediment's capacity for producing pore water AA and DOM. The C-normalized yields of the specific bacterial biomarkers and the correlations with AA yields suggest that bacteria are the major contributors to AA and to changes in POM and pore water DOM composition. In addition to the direct diffusion of altered and recalcitrant DOM out of the sediment, pore waters also provide less altered compounds, such as AA-containing structures, that can survive in the water column when the conditions are unfavorable to degradation (e.g., hypoxia) or be transformed into more recalcitrant DOM. This study suggests, based on different molecular and bulk parameters, that sediments have an important impact on the concentration and composition of the DOM persisting in deep waters.},

	abstract = {The Arctic is experiencing rapid warming, resulting in fundamental shifts in hydrologic connectivity and carbon cycling. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a significant component of the Arctic and global carbon cycle, and significant perturbations to DOM cycling are expected with Arctic warming. The impact of photochemical and microbial degradation, and their interactive effects, on DOM composition and remineralization have been documented in Arctic soils and rivers. However, the role of microbes, sunlight and their interactions on Arctic DOM alteration and remineralization in the coastal ocean has not been considered, particularly during the spring freshet when DOM loads are high, photoexposure can be quite limited and residence time within river networks is low. Here, we collected DOM samples along a salinity gradient in the Yukon River delta, plume and coastal ocean during peak river discharge immediately after spring freshet and explored the role of UV exposure, microbial transformations and interactive effects on DOM quantity and composition. Our results show: (1) photochemical alteration of DOM significantly shifts processing pathways of terrestrial DOM, including increasing relative humification of DOM by microbes by {\textgreater}‚Äâ10\%; (2) microbes produce humic-like material that is not optically distinguishable from terrestrial humics; and (3) size-fractionation of the microbial community indicates a size-dependent role for DOM remineralization and humification of DOM observed through modeled PARAFAC components of fluorescent DOM, either through direct or community effects. Field observations indicate apparent conservative mixing along the salinity gradient; however, changing photochemical and microbial alteration of DOM with increasing salinity indicate changing DOM composition likely due to microbial activity. Finally, our findings show potential for rapid transformation of DOM in the coastal ocean from photochemical and microbial alteration, with microbes responsible for the majority of dissolved organic matter remineralization.},

	abstract = {Heterotrophic bacteria typically take up directly dissolved organic matter due to the small molecular size, although both particulate and dissolved organic matter have labile (easily consumed) compounds. Tropical coastal waters are important ecosystems because of their high productivity. However, few studies have determined bacterial cycling (i.e. carbon uptake by bacteria and allocation for bacterial biomass and respiration) of dissolved organic carbon in coastal tropical waters, and none has determined bacterial cycling of total and dissolved organic carbon simultaneously. In this study we followed bacterial biomass and production, and organic carbon changes over short-term (12 days) dark incubations with (total organic carbon, TOC) and without particulate organic carbon additions (dissolved organic carbon, DOC). The study was performed at three sites along the middle stretch of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) during the dry and wet seasons. Our results show that the bacterial growth efficiency is low (0.1‚Äì11.5\%) compared to other coastal tropical systems, and there were no differences in the carbon cycling between organic matter sources, seasons or locations. Nonetheless, more carbon was consumed in the TOC compared to the DOC incubations, although the proportion allocated to biomass and respiration was similar. This suggests that having more bioavailable substrate in the particulate form did not benefit bacteria. Overall, our study indicates that when comparing the obtained respiration rates with previously measured primary production rates, the GBR is a heterotrophic system. More detailed studies are required to fully explore the mechanisms used by bacteria to cycle TOC and DOC in tropical coastal waters.},

	abstract = {Transmission of sunlight into and through sea ice is of critical importance for sea-ice associated organisms and photosynthesis because light is their primary energy source. The amount of visible light transferred through sea ice contributes to the energy budget of the sea ice and the uppermost ocean. However, our current knowledge on the amount and distribution of light under sea ice is still restricted to a few local observations, and our understanding of light-driven processes and interdisciplinary interactions is still sparse. The main reasons are that the under-ice environment is difÔ¨Åcult to access and that measurements require large logistical and instrumental efforts. Hence, it has not been possible to map light conditions under sea ice over larger areas and to quantify spatial variability on different scales. Here we present a detailed methodological description for operating spectral radiometers on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) under sea ice. Recent advances in ROV and radiation-sensor technology have allowed us to map under-ice spectral radiance and irradiance on Ô¨Çoe scales within a few hours of station time. The ROV was operated directly from the sea ice, allowing for direct relations of optical properties to other sea-ice and surface features. The ROV was Ô¨Çown close to the sea ice in order to capture small-scale variability. Results from the presented data set and similar future studies will allow for better quantiÔ¨Åcation of light conditions under sea ice. The presented experiences will support further developments in order to gather large data sets of under-ice radiation for different ice conditions and during different seasons.},

	abstract = {Arctic sea ice has declined and become thinner and younger (more seasonal) during the last decade. One consequence of this is that the surface energy budget of the Arctic Ocean is changing. While the role of surface albedo has been studied intensively, it is still widely unknown how much light penetrates through sea ice into the upper ocean, affecting sea-ice mass balance, ecosystems, and geochemical processes. Here we present the first large-scale under-ice light measurements, operating spectral radiometers on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) under Arctic sea ice in summer. This data set is used to produce an Arctic-wide map of light distribution under summer sea ice. Our results show that transmittance through first-year ice (FYI, 0.11) was almost three times larger than through multi-year ice (MYI, 0.04), and that this is mostly caused by the larger melt-pond coverage of FYI (42 vs. 23\%). Also energy absorption was 50\% larger in FYI than in MYI. Thus, a continuation of the observed sea-ice changes will increase the amount of light penetrating into the Arctic Ocean, enhancing sea-ice melt and affecting sea-ice and upper-ocean ecosystems.},

Five cores (total length 6.4 m) were analyzed for their structural composition, showing variable contribution of 10‚Äì30\% by granular ice. In these cores, snow had been entrained in 6‚Äì28\% of the total ice thickness. We found evidence of snow contribution in about three quarters of the sea ice cores, when surface granular layers had very low Œ¥18O values. Snow contributed 7.5‚Äì9.7\% to sea ice mass balance on average (including also cores with no snow) based on Œ¥18O mass balance calculations. In SYI cores, snow fraction by mass (12.7‚Äì16.3\%) was much higher than in FYI cores (3.3‚Äì4.4\%), while the bulk salinity of FYI (4.9) was distinctively higher than for SYI (2.7). We conclude that oxygen isotopes and salinity profiles can give information on the age of the ice and enables distinction between FYI and SYI (or older) ice in the area north of Svalbard.},

Optical properties, including chromophoric DOM (CDOM) absorption and Ô¨Çuorescence, as well as concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved carbohydrates (dCHOs) and dissolved uronic acids (dUAs) were measured. Enrichment factors (EFs), calculated from salinity-normalized concentrations of DOM in bulk ice, brine and frost Ô¨Çowers relative to under-ice water, were generally N1. The enrichment factors varied for different DOM fractions: EFs were the lowest for humic-like DOM (1.0‚Äì1.39) and highest for amino acid-like DOM (1.10‚Äì3.94). Enrichment was generally highest in frost Ô¨Çowers with there being less enrichment in bulk ice and brine. Size exclusion chromatography indicated that there was a shift towards smaller molecules in the molecular size distribution of DOM in the samples collected from newly formed ice compared to seawater. Spectral slope coefÔ¨Åcients did not reveal any consistent differences between seawater and ice samples. We conclude that DOM is incorporated to sea ice relatively more than inorganic solutes during initial formation of sea ice and the degree of the enrichment depends on the chemical composition of DOM.},

Here, we investigated how dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition changes both spatially and seasonally along the estuary and how it influences bacterial processing. Surface samples were collected during high tide at fifteen stations throughout the estuary in April, July, October 2017, and January 2018. Bulk, optical, and molecular analyses were conducted on samples before and after dark incubations to assess DOM sources and transformation patterns in the system. The dominant driver of change in DOM composition was found to be the terrigenous-marine gradient in organic matter sources. Six distinct clusters were identified based on the terrigenous signature of the DOM pool, explaining 45\% of the variance in DOM composition in the system. Bacterial consumption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was strongly influenced by DOM composition, with increased degradation rates for DOM with a larger terrigenous character. However, changes in optical properties suggested that less aromatic DOM that co-varied with the terrigenous material was preferentially degraded. The passage of Hurricane Irma in September 2017 resulted in a 27\% ¬± 7\% increase in DOC content, likely due to inundation associated with storm surge and increased local precipitation, and DOC biodegradation was 17\% ¬± 8\% higher than during summer. These effects lasted for at least one month after the storm, revealing that hurricanes can have a large impact on DOM composition and cycling in coastal systems.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex mixture of carbon-containing compounds. The low-molecular weight (LMW) fraction constitutes thousands of different compounds and represents a substantial proportion of DOM in aquatic ecosystems. The turnover rates of this LMW DOM can be extremely high. Due to the challenges of measuring this pool at a molecular scale, comparatively little is known of the fate of LMW DOM compounds in lotic systems. This study addresses this knowledge gap, investigating the microbial processing of LMW DOM across 45 sites representing a range of physicochemical gradients and dominant land covers in the United Kingdom. Radioisotope tracers representing LMW dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (glucose), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) (amino acid mixture), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) (glucose-6-phosphate), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP, measured as orthophosphate) were used to measure the microbial uptake of different DOM compounds in river waters. The amount of DOM biodegradation varied between different components (DON ‚â• DOC {\textgreater} DOP), with the rate of turnover of all three increasing along a gradient of N and P enrichment across the range of sites. Conversely, the uptake of SRP decreased along this same gradient. This was ascribed to preferential utilization of DOP over SRP. Dominant land cover had a significant effect on DOM use as a resource, due to its control of nutrient enrichment within the catchments. We conclude that nutrient enrichment of river waters will lead to further DOM removal from the water column, increased microbial growth, and a decrease in stream oxygen saturation, exacerbating the effects of eutrophication in rivers.},

The shells were measured using X-ray microcomputed tomography (XMCT) scanning and compared to the physical and chemical properties of the water column including the carbonate chemistry and calcium carbonate saturation of calcite and aragonite. Both living L. helicina and N. pachyderma increased in shell density from the surface to 300 m water depth. Turborotalita quinqueloba increased in shell density to 150‚Äì200 m water depth. Deeper than 150 m, T. quinqueloba experienced a loss of density due to internal dissolution, possibly related to gametogenesis. The shell density of recently settled (dead) specimens of planktonic foraminifera from surface sediment samples was compared to the living fauna and showed a large range of dissolution states. This dissolution was not apparent from shell-surface texture, especially for N. pachyderma, which tended to be both thicker and denser than T. quinqueloba. Dissolution lowered the shell density while the thickness of the shell remained intact. Limacina helicina also increase in shell size with water depth and thicken the shell apex with growth. This study demonstrates that the living fauna in this specific area from the Barents Sea did not suffer from dissolution effects. Dissolution occurred after death and after settling on the sea floor. The study also shows that biomonitoring is important for the understanding of the natural variability in shell density of calcifying zooplankton.},

The LPF had low concentration (0‚Äì6 individuals m‚àí3) and small tests (xÃÑ = 103.3 Œºm) in spring and a 53-fold increase (43‚Äì436 individuals m‚àí3) and larger tests (xÃÑ = 188.6 Œºm) in summer. Similarly, the concentration of L. helicina showed a tenfold increase between spring and summer. The LPF species composition remained stable with the exception of the appearance of subtropical species in summer. No relationship was observed between the spatial distribution of LPF, L. helicina, and methane concentrations in the area. The methane plumes in April coincided with elevated dissolved inorganic carbon, low pH, and calcium carbonate saturation states, and the methane concentration seemed to be controlled by lateral advection. The Œ¥13C and Œ¥18O of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma and Turborotalita quinqueloba are comparable to previous observations in the Arctic and do not show any influence of methane in the isotopic signals of the shells. Although no evidence of direct impact of high methane concentrations on the LPF (size and concentration) were found, we speculate that methane could indirectly enhance primary productivity, and thus biomass, through several potential pathways.},

	abstract = {The continental margin off Prins Karls Forland, western Svalbard, is characterized by widespread natural gas seepage into the water column at and upslope of the gas hydrate stability zone. We deployed an ocean bottom seismometer integrated into the MASOX (Monitoring Arctic SeaÔ¨Çoor-Ocean Exchange) automated seabed observatory at the pinch-out of this zone at 389 m water depth to investigate passive seismicity over a continuous 297 day period from 13 October 2010. An automated triggering algorithm was applied to detect over 220,000 short duration events (SDEs) deÔ¨Åned as having a duration of less than 1 s. The analysis reveals two different types of SDEs, each with a distinctive characteristic seismic signature. We infer that the Ô¨Årst type consists of vocal signals generated by moving mammals, likely Ô¨Ånback whales. The second type corresponds to signals with a source within a few hundred meters of the seismometer, either due east or west, that vary on short ( tens of days) and seasonal time scales. Based on evidence of prevalent seaÔ¨Çoor seepage and subseaÔ¨Çoor gas accumulations, we hypothesize that the second type of SDEs is related to subseaÔ¨Çoor Ô¨Çuid migration and gas seepage. Furthermore, we postulate that the observed temporal variations in microseismicity are driven by transient Ô¨Çuid release and due to the dynamics of thermally forced, seasonal gas hydrate decomposition. Our analysis presents a novel technique for monitoring the duration, intensity, and periodicity of Ô¨Çuid migration and seepage at the seabed and can help elucidate the environmental controls on gas hydrate decomposition and release.},

	abstract = {The Arctic Ocean receives a large amount of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) from rivers and more than half of this is removed during its passage through the Arctic Ocean. Terrestrial DOM is generally believed to have a low bioavailability and recent studies point to physicochemical processes such as sea ice formation as the source of the significant DOM removal in the Arctic Ocean. We present the results of a mesocosm experiment designed to investigate how sea ice formation affects DOM composition and bioavailability. We measured the change in different fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) fractions in sea ice, brines (contained in small pores between the ice crystals), and the underlying seawater during a 14 d experiment. Two series of mesocosms were used: one with seawater alone and one with seawater enriched with humic-rich river water. Abiotic processes increased the humic-like FDOM signal in the seawater below the ice during the initial ice formation. Humic-like FDOM fractions with a marine signal were preferentially retained in sea ice (relative to salinity), whereas humic-like FDOM with a terrestrial signal behaved more conservatively with respect to salinity. Amino acid-like FDOM and an unknown FDOM component, only previously found in Antarctic brines, were associated with biological activity and possibly extracellular polymeric substances in sea ice. An additional long-term (226‚Äì228 d) bioassay experiment with seawater collected from the mesocosm experiment revealed that 11\% ¬± 2\% of the bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was bioavailable. However, 16\% ¬± 12\% of DOC expelled from the ice into the seawater below was bioavailable and the bioavailability of DOC in brine was even higher at 45\%. DOM is highly susceptible to physicochemical changes during sea ice formation, leading to modifications in composition and increased bioavailability, which can in part explain terrestrial DOC removal in the Arctic Ocean.},

In this experimental study, we were able to demonstrate a direct link between community composition and ecosystem functioning in that differently structured aquatic bacterial communities differed in their degradation of terrestrially derived DOM. Although the same amount of carbon was processed, both the temporal pattern of degradation and the compounds degraded differed among communities. We, moreover, uncovered that low-molecular-weight carbon was available to all communities for utilisation, whereas the ability to degrade carbon of greater molecular weight was a trait less widely distributed. Finally, whereas the degradation of either low- or high-molecular-weight carbon was not restricted to a single phylogenetic clade, our results illustrate that bacterial taxa of similar phylogenetic classification differed substantially in their association with the degradation of DOM compounds. Applying techniques that capture the diversity and complexity of both bacterial communities and DOM, our study provides new insight into how the structure of bacterial communities may affect processes of biogeochemical significance.},

The indicators included in the BSMP are a combination of simple (e.g. temperature, biomass, and abundance) and complex (e.g. trophic level and biomass of functional groups). The abiotic indicators are found to serve more as a tool to report on climate trends rather than being ecological indicators. It is shown that the selected indicators give a good overview of the ecosystem state, but that overarching management targets and lack of connection between indicators and management actions makes it questionable if the indicator system is suitable for direct use in management as such. The lack of socio-economic and economic indicators prevents a holistic view of the system, and an inclusion of these in future management plans is recommended. The evaluated indicators perform well as an assessment of the ecosystem, but consistency and representativeness are extremely dependent on the time and in what area they are sampled. This conclusion strongly supports the inclusion of an observing system simulation experiment in management plans, to make sure that the observations represent the properties that the indicators need.},

	abstract = {Biogeochemical processes in fjords are likely affected by changes in surrounding glacier cover but very little is known about how meltwater directly influences dissolved organic matter (DOM) in fjords. Moreover, the data available are restricted to a handful of northern hemisphere sites. Here we analyse seasonal and spatial variation in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOM composition (spectrofluorescence, ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry) in Baker-Martinez Fjord, Chilean Patagonia (48¬∞S), to infer the impacts of rapid regional deglaciation on fjord DOM. We show that surface layer DOC concentrations do not vary significantly between seasons, but DOM composition is sensitive to differences in riverine inputs. In summer, higher protein-like fluorescence reflects increased glacial meltwater inputs, whilst molecular level data show weaker influence from marine DOM due to more intense stratification. We postulate that the shifting seasonal balance of riverine and marine waters affects the supply of biolabile peptides and organic nitrogen cycling in the surface layer. Trends in DOM composition with increasing salinity are consistent with patterns in estuaries (i.e. preferential removal of aromatic compounds and increasing relative contribution of unsaturated and heteroatom-rich DOM from marine sources). Preliminary estimates also suggest that at least 10\% of the annual organic carbon stock in this fjord is supplied by the four largest, glacially fed rivers and that these inputs are dominated by dissolved (84\%) over particulate organic carbon. Riverine DOC may therefore be an important carbon subsidy to bacterial communities in the inner fjord. The overall findings highlight the biogeochemical sensitivity of a Patagonian fjord to changes in glacier melt input, which likely has relevance for other glaciated fjords in a warming climate.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex mixture of molecules found ubiquitously in freshwater and saltwater environments. Its structures contain valuable information content on the sources of molecules as well as the mechanisms at work within an aquatic ecosystem. Recent advancements in high resolution mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography have made inroads into determinations of the molecular structures within DOM. Such analyses, however, generally require a prior step to concentrate/isolate DOM, and this step often limits the number of samples that can be analyzed. This study has developed a fast method to concentrate DOM on commercially available online solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, which can be directly eluted onto an HPLC-MS system. This rapid solid phase extraction (RSPE) method requires less sample (10-100 mL) than previous SPE methods for DOM isolation. Additionally, this study tested a suite of SPE phases to find a combination that improves DOM recovery as compared with commonly used approaches. When a polystyrene divinylbenzene phase (RP-1) was coupled with an activated carbon (CAR) phase, recoveries were found to be significantly higher than in previous SPE studies relying upon single phases. RSPE was tested for a diverse set of salty and freshwater samples with recoveries ranging from 46\% to 78\% of the total DOC. It was also tested on a suite of model compounds (including caffeine) and should be applicable to anthropogenic compounds in aquatic environments, although, in such cases, optimization may be needed to minimize the natural organic matter signal that was maximized in this study.},

During the integration period (2010‚Äì2070), only a modest change in climate variables and biological production was found, compared to the inter-annual and decadal variability. The most prominent change was projected for the mid-2040s with a sudden decrease in biological production, largely controlled by covarying changes in heat inflow, wind, and sea-ice extent. The northernmost parts exhibited increased access to light during the productive season due to decreased sea-ice extent, leading to increased primary and secondary production in periods of low sea-ice concentrations. In the southern parts, variable access to nutrients as a function of wind-induced mixing and mixed layer depth were found to be the most dominating factors controlling variability in primary and secondary production.},

	abstract = {Abstract. With the increased occurrence of forest fires around the world, interest in the chemistry of pyrogenic organic matter (pyOM) and its fate in the environment has increased. Upon leaching from soils by rain events, significant amounts of dissolved pyOM (pyDOM) enter the aquatic environment and interact with microbial communities that are essential for cycling organic matter within the different biogeochemical cycles. To evaluate the bio-reactivity of pyDOM, aqueous extracts of laboratory-produced chars were incubated with soil microbes and the molecular changes to the composition of pyDOM were probed using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (Fourier transform ‚Äì ion cyclotron resonance ‚Äì mass spectrometry). Given that photo-degradation also affects the composition and reactivity of pyDOM during terrigenous-to-marine export, the effects of photochemistry were also evaluated in the context of the bio-reactivity of pyDOM. Ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry revealed that, after incubation, many different (both aromatic and aliphatic) compounds were degraded, and new labile compounds, 22‚Äì40‚Äâ\% of which were peptide-like, were produced. This indicated that a portion of pyDOM has been labilized into microbial biomass during the incubations. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra revealed that some fraction of these new molecules is associated with fluorophores from proteinaceous and/or autochthonous/microbial biomass origin. Two-dimensional 1H-1H total correlation NMR spectroscopy identified a peptidoglycan-like backbone within the microbially produced compounds. These results are consistent with previous observations of nitrogen from peptidoglycans within the soil and ocean nitrogen cycles. Interestingly, the exact nature of the bio-produced organic matter was found to vary drastically among samples indicating that the used microbial consortium may produce different exudates based on the composition of the initial pyDOM. Another potential explanation for the vast diversity of molecules is that microbes only consume low molecular weight compounds, but they also produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which initiate oxidative and recombination reactions that produce new molecules. The observed microbially-mediated diversification of pyDOM suggests that pyDOM contributes to the observed large complexity of natural organic matter. More broadly, pyDOM can be substrate for microbial growth and be incorporated in environmental food webs.},

	abstract = {Seasonally ice covered in the past, the fjords in West Spitsbergen turn into being perennially ice free in the present. This feedback to Arctic amplification of global warming changes gas fluxes at the atmosphere-ocean interface. Furthermore, in this Polar region, coupled feedbacks likely enhance Arctic amplification of global warming as numerous gas seepages provide evidence for active gas emissions at the sediment-water interface. We present a time series (2015‚Äì2017) of dissolved methane concentrations combined with hydrographic data in Adventfjorden and Tempelfjorden, two sub-fjords of Isfjorden located at the west coast of Spitsbergen. While both sub-fjords remained permanently supersaturated, we detected pronounced temporal and spatial variations in the methane excess level. Our study revealed that seasonal water transformations were key to seasonally changing methane pathways including potential sea-air flux (efflux). We suggest that a cascade of feedback processes, seasonally triggered by waterside convection and stratification, adjust the amount of methane released and transported within fjord water. When sea ice was missing, strong winter cooling affected the methane supersaturation in contrary directions: first a drop and then a strong increase. In early winter, convective mixing favoured efflux, which reduced the supersaturation. Later in winter, the thermal convection resulted in a continuous overturning of the water column. When the thermal convection reached the bottom, sediment resuspension by turbulence increased, which in turn encouraged enhanced methane release. Subsequently transported along vertical isopycnals, methane from the bottom water reached the water-atmosphere interface. These coupled events created a steady state, simultaneously maintaining supersaturation and efflux. During the warm season, the fjord water became stratified and methane transport occurred mainly laterally in the bottom water. The seasonally changing hydrographic conditions strongly triggered the methane spreading in both sub-fjords and point to a switch between the atmosphere and ocean as main sinks in winter and summer, respectively. Upcoming variations in seasonality, i.e. warmer/cooler summer compared to colder/warmer winter will influence these pathways and the final fate of methane discharged into Arctic fjords.},

To investigate those, we collected a sediment pore-water DOM (SDOM) sample and its overlying seawater to conduct a bioassay experiment, which allowed tracking of both short-term and long-term microbial processes in the context of DOM transformations. Short-term incubation results show that the SDOM extract supported the growth of specific taxa. The microbial community composition changed dramatically and an approximately 50\% of SDOM-derived carbon was consumed within the first 2 days. Viruses likely played a role in promoting bacterial community succession, further enhancing transformation of this SDOM. Long-term incubation results show that labile DOM was gradually consumed, while approximately 16\% of the initial SDOM appeared to be recalcitrant to microbial utilization and remained at the end (after 110 days) of the incubation experiment. Despite the short-term drastic changes in microbial community composition, a highly diverse microbial community is similar to the control at the end of the incubation. It is suggested here that resuspension of coastal sediments weakens their role as a net sink of carbon, with most of the mobilized SDOM transformed by successive microbial communities in the overlying seawater and the remaining recalcitrant organic material becoming part of the long-lived DOM pool. Thus, the bioavailability of the coastal SDOM might influence the carbon budget in coastal oceans.},

	abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is experiencing significant mass loss and freshwater discharge at glacier fronts. The freshwater input from Greenland will impact the physical properties of adjacent coastal seas, including important regions of deep water formation and contribute to global sea level rise. However, the biogeochemical impact of increasing freshwater discharge from the GrIS is less well constrained. Here, we demonstrate the use of bio-optical sensors on ocean gliders to track biogeochemical properties of meltwaters off southwest Greenland. Our results reveal that fresh, coastal waters, with an oxygen isotopic composition characteristic of glacial meltwater, are distinguished by a high optical backscatter and high levels of fluorescing dissolved organic matter (FDOM), representative of the overall colored dissolved organic matter pool. Reconstructions of geostrophic velocities are used to show that these particle and FDOM-enriched coastal waters cross the strong boundary currents into the Labrador Sea. Meltwater input into the Labrador Sea is likely driven by mesoscale processes, such as eddy formation and local bathymetric steering, in addition to wind-driven Ekman transport. Ocean gliders housing bio-optical sensors can provide the high-resolution observations of both dissolved and particulate glacially derived material that are needed to understand meltwater dispersal mechanisms and their sensitivity to future climatic change.},

	abstract = {The MiniFluo-UV is a new glider-compatible optical sensor for measurements of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in natural waters. The working principle, sensor design and challenges faced during the validation phase are reported. The first in situ application of the sensor during three glider deployments in the NW Mediterranean sea (spring, summer, and fall) are also presented. For these campaigns, the two channels of the sensor were adjusted to target Tryptophan-like (excitation/emission wavelengths ŒªEx/ŒªEm: 275/340 nm) and Phenanthrene-like (ŒªEx/ŒªEm: 255/360 nm) fluorescence. These were chosen because they represent fluorophores of interest commonly found in seawater. While Tryptophan (an amino-acid believed to be a by-product of biological activity) is naturally found in the ocean, Phenanthrene (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) is mainly introduced in the environment by human activities. The addition of these variables to more common physical and biogeochemical glider measurements reveals new features of DOM dynamics in the Mediterranean Sea. For example, the temporal and spatial decoupling between Tryptophan-like and Chl-a fluorescence suggests that the former is not only a marker of phytoplankton activity, but could also give more subtle information on the microbial processes occurring. The identification of a Phenanthrene-like layer just below the pycnocline at all seasons also raises questions on the mechanisms driving its presence in the Mediterranean. Knowing that the role of ocean DOM on atmospheric carbon sequestration is becoming clearer, the high spatio-temporal resolution possible with this new sampling strategy may represents a key step toward our deep understanding of DOM dynamics and its role on the biological pump.},

	abstract = {Empirical relationships between particulate organic carbon (POC) and inherent optical properties (IOPs) are required for estimating POC from ocean-color remote sensing and autonomous platforms. The main relationships studied are those between POC and particulate attenuation (cp) and backscattering (bbp) coefficients. The parameters of these relationships can however differ considerably due to differences in the methodologies applied for measuring IOPs and POC as well as variations in particle characteristics. Therefore, it is important to assess existing relationships and explore new optical proxies of POC. In this study, we evaluated empirical relationships between surface POC and IOPs (cp, bbp and the particulate absorption coefficient, ap) using an extensive dataset collected during two Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT 19 and 22) cruises spanning a wide range of oceanographic regimes. IOPs and POC were measured during the two cruises using consistent methodologies. To independently assess the accuracy of the POC-IOPs relationships, we predicted surface POC for AMT-22 using relationships developed based on independent data from AMT-19. We found typical biases in predicting POC ranging between 2‚Äì3, 4‚Äì9, and 6‚Äì13\% for cp, bbp, and ap, respectively, and typical random uncertainties of 20‚Äì30\%. We conclude that (1) accurate POC-cp and POC-bbp relationships were obtained due to the consistent methodologies used to estimate POC and IOPs and (2) ap could be considered as an alternative optical proxy for POC in open-ocean waters, only if all physiological variability in the POC:chl ratio could be modeled and used to correct ap.},

	abstract = {Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important fraction of the marine carbon cycle that controls most light absorption and many photochemical and biological processes in the ocean. Despite its importance, the chemical basis for the formation of oceanic CDOM remains unclear. Currently, CDOM's optical properties are bestdescribed by an electronic interaction (EI) model of charge transfer (CT) complexes which form between electronrich donors and electron-poor acceptors. While terrigenous compounds such as lignin best fit this model, planktonic sources of CDOM have not yet been tested. Here, we have tested CDOM formed during an incubation experiment using a natural phytoplankton assemblage and throughout active growth, stationary phase and algal biomass decomposition. Absorbance of the derived planktonic CDOM generally decreased with increasing wavelength, similar to the reference Pony Lake (PLFA) and Suwanee River (SRFA) fulvic acid solutions used as models of terrigenous CDOM. Further, after 60 d of microbial degradation in the dark, CDOM exhibited fluorescence emission maxima continuously red-shifted into the visible band, consistent with PLFA and SRFA. Reduction of carbonyl-containing groups, key to CT complex formation, with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) produced coherent results in planktonic CDOM and reference FAs. Absorption at 350 nm decreased by 50\% for planktonic CDOM and by 30\% for PLFA and SRFA, with corresponding increases in spectral slope (S) values, indicating preferential loss of absorption well into the visible. Fluorescence likewise responded with enhanced emission at shorter wavelengths. Apparent quantum yields (Œ¶) were similarly affected. Results from our work support prior observations that phytoplankton and bacteria are important sources of CDOM that color the ocean's ‚Äútwilight zone‚Äù. We hypothesize that microbial processing of a variety of source substrates into more complex compounds represented as planktonic CDOM likely represents a semi-refractory pool of DOM in the ocean.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive cross-biome assessment of major nitrogen (N) species that includes dissolved organic N (DON) is central to understanding interactions between inorganic nutrients and organic matter in running waters. Here, we synthesize stream water N chemistry across biomes and find that the composition of the dissolved N pool shifts from highly heterogeneous to primarily comprised of inorganic N, in tandem with dissolved organic matter (DOM) becoming more N-rich, in response to nutrient enrichment from human disturbances. We identify two critical thresholds of total dissolved N (TDN) concentrations where the proportions of organic and inorganic N shift. With low TDN concentrations (0‚Äì1.3 mg/L N), the dominant form of N is highly variable, and DON ranges from 0\% to 100\% of TDN. At TDN concentrations above 2.8 mg/L, inorganic N dominates the N pool and DON rarely exceeds 25\% of TDN. This transition to inorganic N dominance coincides with a shift in the stoichiometry of the DOM pool, where DOM becomes progressively enriched in N and DON concentrations are less tightly associated with concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). This shift in DOM stoichiometry (defined as DOC:DON ratios) suggests that fundamental changes in the biogeochemical cycles of C and N in freshwater ecosystems are occurring across the globe as human activity alters inorganic N and DOM sources and availability. Alterations to DOM stoichiometry are likely to have important implications for both the fate of DOM and its role as a source of N as it is transported downstream to the coastal ocean.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe hydrography of the Arctic Seas is being altered by ongoing climate change, with knock-on effects to nutrient dynamics and primary production. As the major pathway of exchange between the Arctic and the Atlantic, the Fram Strait hosts two distinct water masses in the upper water column, northward flowing warm and saline Atlantic Waters in the east, and southward flowing cold and fresh Polar Surface Water in the west. Here, we assess how physical processes control nutrient dynamics in the Fram Strait using nitrogen isotope data collected during 2016 and 2018. In Atlantic Waters, a weakly stratified water column and a shallow nitracline reduce nitrogen limitation. To the west, in Polar Surface Water, nitrogen limitation is greater because stronger stratification inhibits nutrient resupply from deeper water and lateral nitrate supply from central Arctic waters is low. A historical hindcast simulation of ocean biogeochemistry from 1970-2019 corroborates these findings and highlights a strong link between nitrate supply to Atlantic Waters and the depth of winter mixing, which shoaled during the simulation in response to a local reduction in sea-ice formation. Overall, we find that while the eastern Fram Strait currently experiences seasonal nutrient replenishment and high primary production, the loss of winter sea-ice and continued atmospheric warming has the potential to inhibit deep winter mixing and limit primary production in the future.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents the largest organic matter pool in freshwater systems, but much of it remains molecularly uncharacterized. Although freshwater systems cover only a small area of the earth‚Äôs surface, inland waters are an important component of the global carbon cycle. The traditional idea that rivers are simply conduits for refractory carbon delivery to coastal areas is inconsistent with carbon flux estimates, and streams have been shown to serve as reactors for DOM cycling. The overall quality of DOM, and its associated reactivity, can be related to its chemical composition and molecular structure. However, the variability of DOM composition in freshwater ecosystems, particularly in headwater streams, is poorly characterized. Detailed molecular studies of DOM from small streams across climatic regions, which could provide critical information regarding carbon dynamics on a more global scale, have not been performed. To address these issues, this study applies a multi-method analytical approach in an attempt to assess molecular characteristics of DOM and ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) in headwater streams from different climatic regions in North America. In general terms the chemical and molecular characteristics of UDOM from six different biomes were determined in unsurpassed detail to feature some clear general similarities but also specific differences. While the degree of similarity is remarkable, and suggests similar source strengths, such as soil-derived organic matter and/or similar diagenetic degradation processes for DOM from vastly different environments, each sample was clearly unique in its overall composition, featuring some distinct molecular patterns for at least one or more of the analytical determinations. Molecular and compositional differences of DOM from headwater streams should result from variations in DOM sources and localized environmental conditions, and consequently feature different photo- and bio-reactivity and associated re-mineralization potentials during fluvial transport. Such knowledge could assist in predicting the consequences of global change and its relationship to global carbon cycling.},

One was black smoker hydrothermal fluid at 340¬∞C containing a low concentration of methane with a relatively high carbon isotope ratio (Œ¥13C of methane relative to VPDB), ‚àí7.8‚Ä∞, indicating that methane originated from a magmatic source; thus, this is a fairly ordinary hydrothermal fluid for basalt-hosted hydrothermal activity. In contrast, the other fluid was clear smoker hydrothermal fluid at 117¬∞C containing a high concentration of methane with a very low carbon isotope ratio (‚àí49.7‚Ä∞). The host rock of the Archaean hydrothermal site is basalt, and therefore Fischer-Tropsch-type reactions resulting from serpentinization of mantle rocks are not feasible as a source for the ‚Äúlight‚Äù carbon in methane. Additionally, the carbon isotope ratio of carbon dioxide demonstrated that the sources of CO2 and CH4 were not organic materials. The remaining possibility, biogenic methane, was confirmed by cultivation of hyperthermophilic hydrogen-oxidizing methanogens from both rocks covering the vent of clear smoker hydrothermal fluids and in situ cultivation systems. Although the dominance and abundance of methanogens were very low in this ecosystem, the number was consistent with the relationship between hydrogen concentration and methanogen abundance (Takai et al., 2015). These results suggest that phase separation led to concentration of hydrogen and subsequent persistence of a hyperthermophilic subsurface lithoautotrophic microbial ecosystem in both serpentine-hosted and basalt-hosted hydrothermal systems. This type of ecosystem may occur in similar settings elsewhere on modern earth; in addition, similar communities may have existed in other types of deep-sea hydrothermal systems in the geological past.},

Forty-five vertical casts and tow-yos were conducted: 3 off axis and 42 over the axes of two overlapping propagating ridges, the West and East ridges. These ridges are composed of several nontransform offset ridge segments. Spreading rates range from 149 mm/yr in the segment interiors to 0 mm/yr at the propagating rifts. These maximum spreading rates are considered the fastest on the mid-ocean ridge system and affect the structure of the ridge. Segment-averaged methane plume maxima ranged from 1.7 to 7.2 nM. Mean methane concentrations on the West Ridge were nearly double those of the East Ridge. Westwardly advecting hydrothermal methane persisted to our most distal station, nearly 480 km west of the East Pacific Rise. Background concentrations were less than 1 nM. The highest methane concentration measured was 50 nM in a buoyant plume. Methane did not covary with manganese or any other hydrothermal tracer in plumes over portions of a segment that exhibited recent magmatic activity, possibly as a result of the hydrothermal system's recovery from a phase separation event. In contrast, methane/manganese ratios on the other segments ranged from 0.077 to 0.091. Methane Œ¥13C values in plume maxima ranged from ‚àí27 to ‚àí33‚Ä∞ versus Peedee belemnite; background values were around ‚àí40‚Ä∞.

	abstract = {Geochemical models are used to explore the possibility that lithoautotrophic methanogenesis (the conversion of CO2 plus H2 to methane) could be a source of metabolically useful chemical energy for the production of biomass at putative Europan hydrothermal systems. Two cases are explored: a relatively reduced methane-rich ocean and a relatively oxidized sulfate- and bicarbonate-rich ocean. In the case of a methane-rich ocean, a source of CO2 for methanogenesis is provided by conversion of dissolved methane to CO2 during reaction of ocean water with igneous rocks at high temperatures in the subsurface. Fluid-rock reactions also provide a source of dissolved H2 in the hydrothermal fluid. When this fluid circulates back to the ocean floor and mixes with seawater, conversion of the dissolved CO2 and H2 to methane provides a potential source of chemical energy that can be used to drive metabolic processes. For the case of a sulfate- and carbonate-rich ocean, reaction with reduced igneous rocks at high temperatures will also produce hydrothermal fluids with high H2 concentrations (as occurs in hydrothermal systems on Earth). Mixing of the resulting hydrothermal fluid with seawater in a relatively oxidized ocean could supply energy from either methanogenesis or sulfate reduction. For plausible compositions of a Europan ocean, methanogenesis can supply similar amounts of energy to that which supports the prolific ecosystems surrounding submarine hydrothermal vents on Earth. Even in the most optimistic case, however, the total amount of biomass that could be supported globally by lithoautotrophic microbes on Europa is extremely small compared to the biomass produced photosynthetically on Earth. Nevertheless, sufficient metabolic energy could apparently be available at hydrothermal systems on Europa to support an origin of life and localized ecosystems.},

Ecotones occur at multiple spatial scales, ranging from transitions between biomes to local small-scale transitions. In recent years ecotones have received increasing scientific attention after being neglected for years, as studies historically often focused on distinct communities. However, it is still debatable whether these transitional regions are speciation and biodiversity hotspots that deserve special conservation interest or are actually areas that hold marginal populations that depend on other parts of the range for the maintenance of their biodiversity and therefore should not deserve primary investment. This paper discusses some of the recent advancements in our understanding of the role of ecotones in ecology, evolution, and conservation.},

So far, only two energy sources have been shown to power chemosynthetic symbioses: reduced sulphur compounds and methane. Using metagenome sequencing, single-gene fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, shipboard incubations and in situ mass spectrometry, we show here that the symbionts of the hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge use hydrogen to power primary production. In addition, we show that the symbionts of Bathymodiolus mussels from Pacific vents have hupL, the key gene for hydrogen oxidation. Furthermore, the symbionts of other vent animals such as the tubeworm Riftia pachyptila and the shrimp Rimicaris exoculata also have hupL. We propose that the ability to use hydrogen as an energy source is widespread in hydrothermal vent symbioses, particularly at sites where hydrogen is abundant.},

	abstract = {The amount of metabolic energy available for primary production by chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms in a submarine hydrothermal plume is evaluated using geochemical models. Oxidation of elemental sulfur and metal sulfides precipitated in the hydrothermal plume represent the largest potential sources of metabolic energy in the plume (‚àº600cal/kg vent fluid from each source). Among dissolved substrates, oxidation of H2 potentially provides the greatest amount of energy (‚àº160cal/kg). Smaller, but still significant, amounts of energy are also available from sulfate reduction (54cal/kg), methanogenesis (17cal/kg), and methanotrophy (13cal/kg). Only negligible amounts of energy are available from oxidation of Fe(II) or Mn(II) compounds or Fe3+ reduction ({\textless}1cal/kg vent fluid). The models suggest that most primary production in the plume should occur in the early stages of plume development from sulfur- and H2-oxidizers entrained in the plume or colonizing the surfaces of minerals settling from the plume. The total primary productivity potential in the plume is estimated to be about 50mg dry wt biomass/kg vent fluid. This translates to a global annual biomass production in hydrothermal plumes on the order of 1012g dry wt/yr, which represents only a small fraction of the total photosynthetic biomass production in the oceans (‚àº1017g dry wt/yr). Nevertheless, biomass generated in hydrothermal plumes may represent a significant fraction of the organic matter in the deep ocean as well as that deposited in sediments in ocean basins.},

We have implemented a new module into Gerris that treats buoyancy-driven turbulence by means of a subgrid mode. Our model is validated in numerical experiment and applied to the dynamics of a rising plume. First we simulate hydrothermal plumes in a static environment and compare our results to the widely used integral models (MTT or Briggs‚Äô model). The entrainment coefficient that we deduce from simulations falls into the range of the experimentally determined values. We also investigate the ratio between the level of the neutral-buoyancy layer and the maximum plume height. This ratio is frequently used to estimate plume heat flux via the measured level of neutral buoyancy. Although the ratio is only moderately (less than 10\%) higher than the one predicted by the integral model, heat flux estimations can be substantially different. Finally, we explore the importance of background currents. We find that the simulated trajectories agree with integral models in the rising stage but the subsequent oscillations around the neutral-buoyancy layer are damped much more quickly and the level of the neutral buoyancy is also higher, same as the calm environment cases. By simulating the oscillation of a plume with suppressed transported turbulence and find a stronger oscillation than the original simulation, we suggest that a significant fraction of the difference between our model and the integral model can be explained by the absence of the turbulent transport of the latter.},

Geochemical anomalies (CH4, Mn, 3He), coupled with deviations from ambient T/S linearity, confirmed the existence of a hydrothermal field around 12¬∞50‚Ä≤. New intense hydrothermal venting around 12¬∞43‚Ä≤ was also discovered. These two submarine hydrothermal fields produce effluent plumes which coalesce and form a 250 m thick layer. T/S diagrams show the complex structure of temperature anomalies in the water masses affected by hydrothermal inputs. The hydrothermal clouds are depleted in dissolved oxygen relative to deep-sea water. Simple relationships do not exist between temperature and chemical tracers. The discrepancies result from a combination of various reasons: variable vent fluid characteristics, residence time of tracers in seawater, scavenging and oxidation kinetics of elements and biological activity. However, CH3/3He and Mn/CH4 ratios are comparable to those observed in other hydrothermal fields at spreading axes. These elements and compounds can be used at zero age to describe the variation in hydrothermal activity.},

	abstract = {Submarine hydrothermal fluids discharge as undiluted, high-temperature jets and as diffuse, highly diluted, low-temperature percolation. Estimates of the relative contribution of each discharge type, which are important for the accurate determination of local and global hydrothermal budgets, are difficult to obtain directly. In this paper we describe a new method of using measurements of hydrothermal tracers such as Fe/Mn, Fe/heat, and Mn/heat in high-temperature fluids, low-temperature fluids, and the neutrally buoyant plume to deduce the relative contribution of each discharge type. We sampled vent fluids from the north Cleft vent field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge in 1988, 1989 and 1991, and plume samples every year from 1986 to 1991. The tracers were, on average, 3 to 90 times greater in high-temperature than in low-temperature fluids, with plume values intermediate. A mixing model calculates that high-temperature fluids contribute only ‚àº 3\% of the fluid mass flux but {\textgreater} 90\% of the hydrothermal Fe and {\textgreater} 60\% of the hydrothermal Mn to the overlying plume. Three years of extensive camera-CTD sled tows through the vent field show that diffuse venting is restricted to a narrow fissure zone extending for 18 km along the axial strike. Linear plume theory applied to the temperature plumes detected when the sled crossed this zone yields a maximum likelihood estimate for the diffuse heat flux of8.9 √ó 104 W/m, for a total flux of 534 MW, considering that diffuse venting is active along only one-third of the fissure system. For mean low- and high-temperature discharge of 25¬∞C and 319¬∞C, respectively, the discrete heat flux must be 266 MW to satisfy the mass flux partitioning. If the north Cleft vent field is globally representative, the assumption that high-temperature discharge dominates the mass flux in axial vent fields leads to an overestimation of the flux of many non-conservative hydrothermal species by about an order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {The kinetics of iron particle formation in the neutrally buoyant plume above the TAG vent field (26 degrees N, Mid-Atlantic Ridge) have been calculated from submersible-collected CTD data within the initial 150 m of plume rise. Results show that particles form by a two-stage process: about half the iron in the high temperature vent fluid is removed as sulfides within a few seconds of venting and the remainder is removed by Fe2+ oxidation. The pseudo-first-order rate constant for the second process has been calculated (k1 = 0.329min‚àí1, similar to literature values for seawater) and gives a halflife time for Fe2+ in solution of 2.1 minutes. The kinetics of iron particle formation have been used in a conceptual model of the chemistry of the TAG plume. The average dilution at which iron oxyhydroxide particles form, E¬ØFe, is ‚àº 570 from which element/Fe ratios of particles at the top of the buoyant plume have been predicted. Oxyanion/Fe ratios can be chiefly accounted for by coprecipitation for Cr (71\%), V (67\%), As (45\%) and P (42\%) but Mo (0.1\%) and U (0.02\%) show anomalously low coprecipitation. Th/Fe and REE/Fe ratios are greater than can be accounted for by coprecipitation, demonstrating that scavenging occurs in the buoyant plume for these elements. 98\% of the Th uptake and 15‚Äì75\% of the REE uptake is by scavenging. Scavenging rate constants are 3.1 * 10‚àí6 (nmol/kg)‚àí1 s‚àí1 for Th and 1.4‚Äì33* 10‚àí8 (nmol/kg)‚àí1 s‚àí1 for the REE. A scavenging model has been fitted to trace metal data previously reported for neutrally buoyant hydrothermal plume particulate samples collected above the TAG vent field. The model is based on the assumption that there is a characteristic t1/2 for the dilution of the neutrally buoyant plume and this value has been calculated, by comparing228Th and230Th with234Th isotope data, as fourty-one days (Œªp = 0.0170 day‚àí1). Scavenging rate constants are 2* 10‚àí9 (nmol/kg)‚àí1 s‚àí1 for Th and 3.5‚Äì16*10‚àí11 (nmol/kg)‚àí1 s‚àí1 for the REE. This shows preferential removal of the intermediate REE from sea water, a pattern which has also been found in those TAG sediments formed from neutrally buoyant plume fallout. Chalcophile elements (Cu, Zn, Co, Pb, Sn) all appear to undergo release from plume particles at the same rate (t1/2 ‚âà 42days) suggesting alteration or removal of a common substrate. Model ages for particles above the TAG vent field are {\textless}50 days within 500 m of the vent field and 50‚Äì100 days at greater distances or below the height of the neutral plume. Quantitative removal of vent fluid derived REE, with the possible exception of Eu, during buoyant plume rise means that hydrothermal activity has no direct impact on the seawater chemistry of the REE. If coprecipitation and scavenging within the TAG hydrothermal plume are typical, such processes during plume rise (the buoyant plume) and dispersion (the neutrally buoyant plume) play a significant role in the removal of reactive trace metals and oxyanions from seawater, at rates of the same order as those of river input to the oceans.},

	abstract = {A turbulent entrainment model of a hydrothermal plume was modified to include the effects of vertical structure in the background temperature and salinity fields. Owing to the stably stratified salinity field in the Pacific, relatively warm, salty water spreads at an equilibrium level, where the plume density equals the ambient density. In contrast, the unstable salinity profile in the Atlantic gives the plume added buoyancy, and it continues to rise to an equilibrium level where it is relatively cool and fresh. These attributes result from the mixing between the plume and the surrounding seawater at each level below the spreading layer. The equilibrium temperature anomaly is not directly proportional to the source strength but depends on the mixing and background salinity gradient. The net entrainment of surrounding seawater is greater in the Atlantic plume model than in the Pacific plume model for the same buoyancy flux. Recent data from the TAG hydrothermal field at 26¬∞N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and data from a vent field on the Endeavor segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge are compared to model results. The model predicts the penetration height and Œ∏-S characteristics of the Atlantic plume, and it explains some of the differences between the observed Atlantic and Pacific hydrothermal plumes.},

	abstract = {The H√•kon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV) is a cold methane-venting seep situated at the Norwegian‚ÄìBarents‚ÄìSpitsbergen continental margin. Methane discharged by the vent creates a plume in the ambient seawater at 1200 m water depth. Here, we study the hydrographic regime to evaluate its influence on the distribution pattern of methane as it is shown by the concentration gradients. The stable carbon isotopic signature of methane is used to trace the vent methane in the lateral and vertical direction and to trace its fate in the hydrosphere. Direct methane release into the bottom water occurs in the central zone of the HMMV. Methane included in the subseafloor reservoir and in the plume above the vent has the same carbon isotopic ratios, which means that the released methane is not oxidized. The shape of the methane plume is determined by spreading predominantly along its original isopycnal. However, vent methane is traceable in seawater up to 800 m above the HMMV by methane values, which exceed the background and high carbon isotopic signature heterogeneity. The fate of vent methane in the hydrosphere is dominated by dilution and mixing with background methane within the bottom water rather than by oxidation as it is shown by the carbon isotopic ratios. Methane released by the HMMV moves northward with deep intermediate waters, which are detached from the ocean surface and may enter the polar Arctic Ocean. Consequently, methane discharged at the HMMV results in a direct input of fossil methane into the Recent methane reservoir of the deeper ocean and reduces the capacity of the deep ocean as a sink for atmospheric methane.},

	abstract = {Thick ice cover is a feature of cold-temperate, polar, and alpine lakes and rivers throughout much of the year. Our observations from Canadian lakes and rivers across the latitudinal gradient 46‚Äì80¬∞N show that their overlying ice contains low concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) relative to the underlying waters. The CDOM exclusion factor (water/ice) ranged from 1.4 to 114 and was typically greater than twice the exclusion factor for inorganic solutes. Application of synchronous fluorescence analysis to lake ice samples and experimentally frozen lakewater indicated that only less complex, lower molecular weight molecules were retained within the ice. Consistent with this analysis, DOC-specific absorption showed that the DOC in the ice was generally less colored than that in the underlying waters. The reduced CDOM absorption within the ice allowed relatively high ultraviolet (UV) transmission despite the elevated scattering within the ice and resulted in UV diffuse attenuation coefficients up to eight times lower in the ice than in the underlying waters. This relatively low attenuation by the ice would cause organisms trapped near the surface by inverse stratification to experience high UV exposure prior to ice breakup. The ice exclusion effect gives rise to a concentrated zone of CDOM and DOC that is likely to favor heterotrophic and mixotrophic processes and influence biogeochemical interactions.},

Our study quantifies the distributions of bacteria and solutes between liquid and solid water phases during progressive freezing. We simulated lake ice formation in mesocosm experiments using water from perennially (Antarctica) and seasonally (Alaska and Montana, United States) ice-covered lakes. We then computed concentration factors and effective segregation coefficients, which are parameters describing the incorporation of bacteria and solutes into ice. Experimental results revealed that, contrary to major ions, bacteria were readily incorporated into ice and did not concentrate in the liquid phase. The organic matter incorporated into the ice was labile, amino acid-like material, differing from the humic-like compounds that remained in the liquid phase. Results from a control mesocosm experiment (dead bacterial cells) indicated that viability of bacterial cells did not influence the incorporation of free bacterial cells into ice, but did have a role in the formation and incorporation of bacterial aggregates. Together, these findings demonstrate that bacteria, unlike other solutes, were preferentially incorporated into lake ice during our freezing experiments, a process controlled mainly by the initial solute concentration of the liquid water source, regardless of cell viability.},

	abstract = {Methane, a common trace constituent of groundwaters, occasionally makes up more than 20\% of the total carbon in groundwaters1,2. In aerobic environments CH4‚Äìrich waters can enable microbial food chain supporting a mixed culture of bacteria with methane oxidation as the primary energy source to develop3. Such processes may influence the isotopic composition of the residual methane and because 13C/12C analyses have been used to characterize the genesis of methanes found in different environments, an understanding of the magnitude of such effects is necessary. In addition, carbon dioxide produced by the methane-utilizing bacteria can be added to the inorganic carbon pool of affected groundwaters. We found carbon dioxide experimentally produced by methane-utilizing bacteria to be enriched in 12C by 5.0‚Äì29.6‚Ä∞, relative to the residual methane. Where methane-bearing groundwaters discharged into aerobic environments microbial methane oxidation occurred, with the residual methane becoming progressively enriched in 13C. Various models have been proposed to explain the 13C/12C and 14C content of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of groundwaters in terms of additions or losses during flow in the subsurface4,5. The knowledge of both stable carbon isotope ratios in various pools and the magnitude of carbon isotope fractionation during various processes allows geochemists to use the 13C/12C ratio of the DIC along with water chemistry to estimate corrected 14C groundwater ages4,5. We show here that a knowledge of the carbon isotope fractionation between CH4 and CO2 during microbial methane-utilization could modify such models for application to groundwaters affected by microbial methane oxidation.},

	abstract = {Previous work has shown that methane anomalies frequently occur within the rift valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). The plumes appear confined within the high, steep walls of the valley, and it is not known whether methane may escape to the open ocean outside. In order to investigate this question, the concentration and 13C/12C ratio of methane together with CCl3F concentration were measured in the northeastern Atlantic including the rift valley near 50¬∞N. This segment contained methane plumes centered several 100m above the valley floor with Œ¥13C values mostly between ‚Äì15‚Ä∞ and ‚Äì10‚Ä∞. A limited number of helium isotope measurements showed that Œ¥3He increased to 17\% at the bottom of the valley, which suggests the helium and methane sources may be spatially separated. In the eastern Atlantic away from the ridge (48¬∞N, 20¬∞W), the methane concentration decreased monotonically from the surface to the bottom, but the methane Œ¥13C exhibited a mid-water maximum of about ‚Äì25‚Ä∞. The bottom water methane contained a significantly lower Œ¥13C of about ‚Äì36‚Ä∞. Thus, it appears that isotopically heavy methane escapes from the MAR into North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) that contacts the ridge crest while circulating to the east. The formation of NADW supplies isotopically light methane that dilutes the input of heavy carbon from the ridge. We employed a time-dependent box model to calculate the extent of isotope dilution and thereby the flux of MAR methane into the NADW circulation. The degree of methane oxidation, which affects the 13C/12C of methane through kinetic isotope fractionation, was estimated by comparing methane and CFC-11 model results with observations. The model calculations indicate a MAR methane source of about 0.06√ó10‚àí9molL‚àí1yr‚àí1 to waters at the depth of the ridge crest. Assuming this extends to a 500m thick layer over half of the entire Atlantic, the amount of methane escaping from the MAR to the open ocean is estimated to be about 1√ó109molyr‚àí1. The total production of methane within the rift valley is likely much greater than the flux from the valley to the outside because of local oxidation. This implies that serpentinization of ultramafic rocks supports much of methane production in the rift valley because the amount expected from basalt degassing in association with mantle helium ({\textless}0.6√ó109molCH4yr‚àí1) is less than even the net amount escaping from the valley. The model results also indicate the methane specific oxidation rate is about 0.05yr‚àí1 in open waters of the northern Atlantic.},

Hydrogen isotope fractionation factors for C1, C2 and C3 were determined concurrently. Fresh sediment samples from two seep areas were each slurried with sea water and treated with C1, C2, C3 or C4, or with mixtures of all four gases. Triplicate samples were incubated aerobically at 15¬∞C, and the stable isotope composition and headspace levels of C1‚ÄìC4 were monitored over the course of the experiment. Oxidation was observed for all C1‚ÄìC4 gases, with an apparent preference for C3 and C4 over C1 and C2 in the mixed-gas treatments. Fractionation factors were calculated using a Rayleigh model by comparing the Œ¥13C and Œ¥D of the residual C1‚ÄìC4 gases to their headspace levels. Carbon isotope fractionation factors (reported in Œµ or (Œ±-1)√ó1000 notation) were consistent between seep areas and were ‚àí26.5‚Ä∞¬±3.9 for C1, ‚àí8.0‚Ä∞¬±1.7 for C2, ‚àí4.8‚Ä∞¬±0.9 for C3 and ‚àí2.9‚Ä∞¬±0.9 for C4. Fractionation factors determined from mixed gas incubations were similar to those determined from individual gas incubations, though greater variability was observed during C1 consumption. In the case of C1 and C3 consumption, carbon isotope fractionation appears to decrease as substrate becomes limiting. Hydrogen isotope fractionation factors determined from the two seep areas differed for C1 oxidation but were similar for C2 and C3. Hydrogen isotope fractionation factors ranged from ‚àí319.9‚Ä∞ to ‚àí156.4‚Ä∞ for C1 incubations, and averaged ‚àí61.9‚Ä∞¬±8.3 for C2 incubations and ‚àí15.1‚Ä∞¬±1.9 for C3 incubations. The fractionation factors presented here may be applied to estimate the extent of C1‚ÄìC4 oxidation in natural gas samples, and should prove useful in further studying the microbial oxidation of these compounds in the natural environment.},

The hydrothermal end-member concentrations and Œ¥13C of methane show near-homogeneity among vents: 41.2 (Œºmol/kg) and ‚àí16.3 ¬± 0.8 (‚Ä∞PDB), respectively, while those in the effluent plume are stratified in the caldera and vertically exhibit a large variation (2.1‚Äì11 (nmol/kg) and ‚àí29.0 to ‚àí11.3 (‚Ä∞PDB), respectively). Comparison of concentration and Œ¥13C data between vent fluids and plume waters suggest that the methane is not conserved but microbially oxidized along with the plume. Gradual decrease of diffusive methane flux in proportion to distance from the vent fields supports the occurrence of significant microbial oxidation within the plume. Assuming steady state emission of methane from the vents, (1) kinetic isotope effect due to the microbial oxidation (k12/k13); (2) methane flux from the vents (Fvents); (3) heat flux from the vents (Q); and (4) average turnover time of hydrothermal methane (Tall) are estimated to be k12/k13 = 1.005 ¬± 0.001, Fvents = 90‚Äì340 (mol/d), Q = 30‚Äì110 (MW), and Tall = 60‚Äì240 (d), respectively. The estimated turnover times, however, are not uniform within the water column. Around the vents, a turnover time of less than 50 d for methane is one of the shortest values in the pelagic ocean, while those at the distant points correspond to values more typical for deep ocean water.},

	abstract = {As methane is consumed in the deep sea, its 13C/12C ratio progressively increases because of kinetic isotope fractionation. Many submarine hydrothermal vents emit methane with carbon isotope ratios that are higher than those of background methane in the surrounding ocean. Since the latter exists at low concentrations, mixing of background methane with vent fluid tends to decrease the 13C/12C ratio as concentration decreases, opposite to the trend produced by consumption. We investigated CH4 concentration and Œ¥13C together with Œ¥3He in plumes from the Logatchev hydrothermal field (LHF) located at 14¬∞45‚Ä≤N, 45¬∞W, which generates relatively heavy methane (Œ¥13C ‚âà ‚àí13‚Ä∞) by serpentinization of ultramafic rock. The measured methane and Œ¥3He were well correlated at high concentrations, indicating a CH4/3He ratio of 1 √ó 108 in the vent fluids. These tracer distributions were also simulated with an advection-diffusion model in which methane consumption only occurs above a certain threshold concentration. We utilized Œ¥3He to calculate the methane remaining in solution after oxidation, f, and the deviation of Œ¥13C from the value expected from mixing alone, ŒîŒ¥13C. Both in the model and in the data, the entire set of ŒîŒ¥13C values are not correlated with log f, which is due to continuous oxidation within the plume while mixing with background seawater. A linear relationship, however, is found in the model for methane at concentrations sufficiently above background, and many of the samples with elevated CH4 north of LHF exhibit a linear trend of ŒîŒ¥13C versus log f as well. From this trend, the kinetic isotope fractionation factor in the LHF plumes appears to be about 1.015. This value is somewhat higher than found in some other deep-sea studies, but it is lower than found in laboratory incubation experiments.},

	abstract = {Hydrographic surveys along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) between 12¬∞N and 26¬∞N, carried out from 1984 to 1990, show a variable pattern of CH4-rich water column plumes. The vertical distribution of CH4 at stations located every 20‚Äì40 km is presented along this 1200-km-long section of the MAR. CH4 venting is clearly demonstrated. CH4-enriched fluids rise from vents as plumes; spreading is confined to the axial valley due to the topography of the MAR. CH4 contents from 45 nmol to 675 nmol/kg are measured in the buoyant plumes above the two active hydrothermal sites (MARK 23¬∞N; TAG 26¬∞N) known at present, whereas CH4 anomalies up to 3.6 nmol/kg are typically observed in plumes emitted either on the inner floor, on the walls, and/or at the top of the rift mountains along the studied ridge section. CH4 concentrations (45 Œºmol to 144 Œºmol/kg) in MARK and TAG vent fluids are of the same order of magnitude as those found in the East Pacific Rise fluids. Even though CH4 is known to be unstable with respect to oxidation by dissolved oxygen, and in spite of its microbial oxidation in plumes, these results confirm CH4 to be a good indicator to track hydrothermal plumes and to map the variation of hydrothermal activity along mid oceanic ridges. Moreover, between 12¬∞ and 26¬∞N along the MAR, CH4 results show that while hydrothermal activity is present everywhere along the ridge, it is predominant near fracture zones (FZ) (Kane FZ, 15¬∞20‚Ä≤N FZ). Comparison of CH4 tracer with total dissolvable manganese (TDM) tracer in plumes allows us to differentiate subseafloor hydrothermal processes. The high TDM/CH4 found above TAG and MARK areas is indicative of basalt-seawater interaction, while at 15¬∞N the low TDM/CH4 provides evidence of fluid circulation in ultrabasic rocks. CH4 data confirm the association between mantle degassing, hydrothermal activity, and serpentinization along this 12¬∞‚Äì26¬∞N section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.},

	abstract = {Although initially viewed as oases within a barren deep ocean, hydrothermal vent and methane seep communities are now recognized to interact with surrounding ecosystems on the sea floor and in the water column, and to affect global geochemical cycles. The importance of understanding these interactions is growing as the potential rises for disturbance from oil and gas extraction, seabed mining and bottom trawling. Here we synthesize current knowledge of the nature, extent and time and space scales of vent and seep interactions with background systems. We document an expanded footprint beyond the site of local venting or seepage with respect to elemental cycling and energy flux, habitat use, trophic interactions, and connectivity. Heat and energy are released, global biogeochemical and elemental cycles are modified, and particulates are transported widely in plumes. Hard and biotic substrates produced at vents and seeps are used by ‚Äúbenthic background‚Äù fauna for attachment substrata, shelter, and access to food via grazing or through position in the current, while particulates and fluid fluxes modify planktonic microbial communities. Chemosynthetic production provides nutrition to a host of benthic and planktonic heterotrophic background species through multiple horizontal and vertical transfer pathways assisted by flow, gamete release, animal movements, and succession, but these pathways remain poorly known. Shared species, genera and families indicate that ecological and evolutionary connectivity exists among vents, seeps, organic falls and background communities in the deep sea; the genetic linkages with inactive vents and seeps and background assemblages however, are practically unstudied. The waning of venting or seepage activity generates major transitions in space and time that create links to surrounding ecosystems, often with identifiable ecotones or successional stages. The nature of all these interactions is dependent on water depth, as well as regional oceanography and biodiversity. Many ecosystem services are associated with the interactions and transitions between chemosynthetic and background ecosystems, for example carbon cycling and sequestration, fisheries production, and a host of non-market and cultural services. The quantification of the sphere of influence of vents and seeps could be beneficial to better management of deep-sea environments in the face of growing industrialization.},

Atmospheric CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} concentration is measured directly and its growth rate ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{G}$_{\textrm{ATM}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration.

The uptake of organic matter by bacteria is a major carbon-flow pathway, and its variability can change the overall flux of carbon in the ocean and, therefore, globally.Organic matter in seawater is present as transparent gels that are composed of colloids, mucus sheets and bundles. It is important to consider how microorganisms interact with organic matter that is present in this form. Growth rates of bacteria in the ocean are important, but estimates based on the bulk phase could be inaccurate. It is feasible that hot spots of nutrients allow bursts of fast growth in a boom-and-bust cycle.Marine snow is an important component of the organic carbon in the ocean on which bacteria can reach high cell densities. Understanding the biochemical bases of the interactions of bacteria with marine snow will enable us to begin to link carbon storage and carbon biochemistry with gene expression in the bacteria that are present on these aggregates.Microbial oceanography is a field that is caught between scales ‚Äî microbial processes must be understood at the scale of the individual microorganism, but yet we want to understand the cumulative influence of microbial processes on how the ocean works as a biogeochemical system. We argue that understanding how bacteria interact with the ocean system at the nanometre to millimetre scales provides insights into biogeochemical processes of global significance.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Amino acids (AA) mainly bound in proteins are major constituents of living biomass and non-living organic material in the oceanic particulate and dissolved organic matter pool. Uptake and cycling by heterotrophic organisms lead to characteristic changes in AA composition so that AA based biogeochemical indicators are often used to elucidate processes of organic matter cycling and degradation. We analyzed particulate AA in a large sample set collected in various oceanic regions covering sinking and suspended particles in the water column, sediment samples as well as dissolved AA from water column and pore water samples. The aim of this study was to test and improve the use of AA derived biogeochemical indicators as proxies for organic matter sources and degradation, and to better understand particle dynamics and interaction between the dissolved and particulate organic matter pools. A principal component analysis (PCA) of all data delineates diverging AA compositions of sinking and suspended particles with increasing water depth. A new sinking particle and sediment degradation indicator (SDI) allows a fine-tuned classification of sinking particles and sediments with respect to the intensity of degradation, which is associated with changes of bulk Œ¥15N ratios. This new indicator furthermore is sensitive to sedimentary redox conditions and can be used to detect past anoxic early diagenesis. A second indicator emerges from the AA spectra of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the epipelagic and that of the meso- and bathypelagic ocean and is a residence time indicator (RTI). The characteristic changes in AA patterns from shallow to deep SPM are recapitulated in the AA spectra of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool, so that deep SPM is more similar to DOM than to any of the other organic matter pools. This implies that there is equilibration between finely dispersed SPM and DOM in the deep sea, which may be driven by microbial activity combined with annealing and fragmentation of gels. As these processes strongly depend on physico-chemical conditions in the deep ocean, changes in quality and degradability of DOM may strongly affect the relatively large pool of suspended and dissolved AA in the ocean that amounts to 15‚ÄâPg amino acid carbon (AAC) and 89‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ29‚ÄâPg AAC, respectively.},

	abstract = {Atlantic Water (AW) flowing along the western and northern Svalbard shelf-break extends the Atlantic domain into the Arctic and is the region‚Äôs major source of heat, nutrients and advected plankton. We investigated the inflow and recirculation of AW into four major troughs that cut into the Svalbard shelf, the Isfjorden, Kongsfjorden, Hinlopen and Kvit√∏ya Troughs, and related the circulation patterns to acoustic backscatter observed with echosounders and Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers. The acoustic observations showed higher levels of backscatter from fish in the Hinlopen Trough compared to the shelf and shelf-break north of Svalbard. This coincides with a steady inflow of nutrients, biomass and heat into the trough with the AW. Trough circulation was characterized using output from a high-resolution regional ocean model and particle tracking simulations. All four troughs experience topographically steered recirculation (in-and-outflow) of AW, but the troughs on the western Svalbard shelf showed a stronger seasonality than the troughs on the northern shelf. The Hinlopen Trough receives the strongest AW inflow and the most direct inflow from the shelf-break boundary current. The troughs form hybrid habitats between the shelf and shelf-break that extend the Atlantic advective domain closer to the Svalbard coastline.},

	abstract = {Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that has contributed approximately 20 to the Earth s warming since pre-industrial times. The world s oceans are an important source of methane, comprising 1-4 of annual global emissions. But despite its global significance, oceanic methane production is poorly understood. In particular, methane concentrations in the surface waters of most of the world s oceans are supersaturated with respect to atmospheric concentrations, but the origin of this methane, which has been thought to be produced exclusively in anaerobic environments, is not known. Here, we measure methane production in seawater samples amended with methylphosphonate, an organic, phosphorus-containing compound. We show that methane is produced aerobically as a by-product of methylphosphonate decomposition in phosphate-stressed waters. Methylphosphonate decomposition, and thus methane production, may be enhanced by the activity of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms. We suggest that aerobic marine methane production will be sensitive to the changes in water-column stratification and nutrient limitation that are likely to result from greenhouse-gas-induced ocean warming.},

The sample set used for the comparison included stations in a tidal urban river, the salinity gradient of an estuary, and continental shelf and slope waters, including those to a depth of 2000 m. Both high temperature combustion methods measured considerably more DOC (1.5 to 3.5 times) in the coastal waters than did the conventional persulfate method. In the fresh water and estuary, the commercial instrument measured only slightly higher values than did the conventional method, while the MRI instrument measured almost twice the concentration. Throughout all the environments, the MRI instrument measured about twice the concentration measured by the commercial instrument. An inverse linear correlation can be demonstrated between DOC and apparent oxygen utilization with data from each of the methods, but it is argued that this does not necessarily imply ‚Äòoceanographic consistency‚Äô.},

	abstract = {Seafloor methane release due to the thermal dissociation of gas hydrates is pervasive across the continental margins of the Arctic Ocean. Furthermore, there is increasing awareness that shallow hydrate-related methane seeps have appeared due to enhanced warming of Arctic Ocean bottom water during the last century. Although it has been argued that a gas hydrate gun could trigger abrupt climate change, the processes and rates of subsurface/atmospheric natural gas exchange remain uncertain. Here we investigate the dynamics between gas hydrate stability and environmental changes from the height of the last glaciation through to the present day. Using geophysical observations from offshore Svalbard to constrain a coupled ice sheet/gas hydrate model, we identify distinct phases of subglacial methane sequestration and subsequent release on ice sheet retreat that led to the formation of a suite of seafloor domes. Reconstructing the evolution of this dome field, we find that incursions of warm Atlantic bottom water forced rapid gas hydrate dissociation and enhanced methane emissions during the penultimate Heinrich event, the B√∏lling and Aller√∏d interstadials, and the Holocene optimum. Our results highlight the complex interplay between the cryosphere, geosphere, and atmosphere over the last 30,000 y that led to extensive changes in subseafloor carbon storage that forced distinct episodes of methane release due to natural climate variability well before recent anthropogenic warming.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms regulating the distributions of dissolved methane in North Pacific Ocean waters were investigated. Water column and sediment trap samples were collected in representative oceanic provinces ranging from the high productivity coastal waters of central California to the oligotrophic ocean near Hawaii. Methane was supersaturated in surface waters throughout the study area with values ranging from 105 to 175\%, relative to equilibrium with atmospheric methane. Generally, the greatest supersaturations were found in coastal areas. The methane concentrations in oceanic waters off Hawaii are largely determined by in-situ production and air-sea gas exchange. Near the California coast, sediment and near-bottom inputs become important as potential sources of methane to the water column. Methane measurements in preserved and unpreserved sediment trap solutions documented a sinking particle-associated methane source that was most apparent in the upper 200 m of the water column, and that tended to increase towards the surface and with distance from shore. The exact source of the methane accumulating in the traps could not be determined, but the trap data are consistent with a net in-situ production occurring in surface water microhabitats and, perhaps, macrozooplankton intestinal tracts. In the oligotrophic waters near Hawaii, this novel methane source term may be the most important in-situ process and may help resolve the previously described upper water column methane supersaturation paradox.},

	abstract = {The oceanic water column has not been a traditional object for geochemical research, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) used to be an exotic topic at geochemical conferences. This is no longer the case as the DOM pool is now recognized as paralleling the sedimentary record as an information-rich set of tracers. These molecules carry the signatures of their source and subsequent journey through the environment. Most of the photosynthetic production in the ocean is consumed by bacteria. Bacteria can only assimilate dissolved molecules, and DOM is therefore the main mediator for the flux of energy in the ocean. A minor fraction of DOM, however, escapes microbial decomposition. This fraction of DOM has accumulated to one of the largest organic carbon pools on Earth. DOM contains as much carbon as all living biomass on the continents and oceans combined, and a similar amount of carbon as atmospheric CO2. Due to its great size, even minor changes in the DOM pool will impact global biogeochemical cycles and the heat budget of the Earth. The accumulation of DOM in the ocean over several millennia is enigmatic and contradicts established paradigms in geochemistry for organic matter stabilization. This chapter focuses on major concepts, the fundamental challenges, and the future directions of this fast growing field of research.},

	abstract = {The circulation of hydrothermal fluid through the upper oceanic crustal reservoir has a large impact on the chemistry of seawater, yet the impact on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the ocean has received almost no attention. To determine whether hydrothermal circulation is a source or a sink for DOC in the oceans, we measured DOC concentrations in hydrothermal fluids from several environments. Hydrothermal fluids were collected from high-temperature vents and diffuse, low-temperature vents on the basalt-hosted Juan de Fuca Ridge axis and also from low-temperature vents on the sedimented eastern flanks. High-temperature fluids from Main Endeavour Field (MEF) and Axial Volcano (AV) contain very low DOC concentrations (average=15 and 17ŒºM, respectively) compared to background seawater (36ŒºM). At MEF and AV, average DOC concentrations in diffuse fluids (47 and 48ŒºM, respectively) were elevated over background seawater, and high DOC is correlated with high microbial cell counts in diffuse fluids. Fluids from off-axis hydrothermal systems located on 3.5-Ma-old crust at Baby Bare Seamount and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 1026B had average DOC concentrations of 11 and 13ŒºM, respectively, and lowered DOC was correlated with low cell counts. The relative importance of heterotrophic uptake, abiotic sorption to mineral surfaces, thermal decomposition, and microbial production in fixing the DOC concentration in vent fluids remains uncertain. We calculated the potential effect of hydrothermal circulation on the deep-sea DOC cycle using our concentration data and published water flux estimates. Maximum calculated fluxes of DOC are minor compared to most oceanic DOC source and sink terms.},

We treat Arabia, India and Australia, and North America and South America as distinct plates, but combine Nubia and Somalia into a single African plate because motion between them could not be reliably resolved. The 1122 data from 22 plate boundaries inverted to obtain NUVEL-1 consist of 277 spreading rates, 121 transform fault azimuths, and 724 earthquake slip vectors. We determined all rates over a uniform time interval of 3.0m.y., corresponding to the centre of the anomaly 2A sequence, by comparing synthetic magnetic anomalies with observed profiles. The model fits the data well. Unlike prior global plate motion models, which systematically misfit some spreading rates in the Indian Ocean by 8‚Äì12mm yr‚àí1, the systematic misfits by NUVEL-1 nowhere exceed ‚àº3 mm yr‚àí1. The model differs significantly from prior global plate motion models. For the 30 pairs of plates sharing a common boundary, 29 of 30 P071, and 25 of 30 RM2 Euler vectors lie outside the 99 per cent confidence limits of NUVEL-1. Differences are large in the Indian Ocean where NUVEL-1 plate motion data and plate geometry differ from those used in prior studies and in the Pacific Ocean where NUVEL-1 rates are systematically 5‚Äì20 mm yr‚àí1 slower than those of prior models. The strikes of transform faults mapped with GLORIA and Seabeam along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge greatly improve the accuracy of estimates of the direction of plate motion. These data give Euler vectors differing significantly from those of prior studies, show that motion about the Azores triple junction is consistent with plate circuit closure, and better resolve motion between North America and South America. Motion of the Caribbean plate relative to North or South America is about 7 mm yr‚àí1 slower than in prior global models. Trench slip vectors tend to be systematically misfit wherever convergence is oblique, and best-fitting poles determined only from trench slip vectors differ significantly from their corresponding closure-fitting Euler vectors. The direction of slip in trench earthquakes tends to be between the direction of plate motion and the normal to the trench strike. Part of this bias may be due to the neglect of lateral heterogeneities of seismic velocities caused by cold subducting slabs, but the larger part is likely caused by independent motion of fore-arc crust and lithosphere relative to the overriding plate.},

	abstract = {We describe best-fitting angular velocities and MORVEL, a new closure-enforced set of angular velocities for the geologically current motions of 25 tectonic plates that collectively occupy 97 per cent of Earth's surface. Seafloor spreading rates and fault azimuths are used to determine the motions of 19 plates bordered by mid-ocean ridges,
including all the major plates. Six smaller plates with little or no connection to the mid-ocean ridges are linked to MORVEL with GPS station velocities and azimuthal data. By design, almost no kinematic
information is exchanged between the geologically determined and
geodetically constrained subsets of the global circuit-MORVEL thus averages motion over geological intervals for all the major plates. Plate geometry changes relative to NUVEL-1A include the incorporation of Nubia, Lwandle and Somalia plates for the former Africa plate,
Capricorn, Australia and Macquarie plates for the former Australia plate, and Sur and South America plates for the former South America plate. MORVEL also includes Amur, Philippine Sea, Sundaland and Yangtze plates, making it more useful than NUVEL-1A for studies of deformation in Asia and the western Pacific. Seafloor spreading rates are estimated over the past 0.78 Myr for intermediate and fast spreading centres and since 3.16 Ma for slow and ultraslow spreading centres. Rates are adjusted downward by 0.6-2.6mmyr-1 to compensate for the
several kilometre width of magnetic reversal zones. Nearly all the NUVEL-1A angular velocities differ significantly from the MORVEL angular velocities. The many new data, revised plate geometries, and correction for outward displacement thus significantly modify our knowledge of geologically current plate motions. MORVEL indicates significantly slower 0.78-Myr-average motion across the Nazca-Antarctic and
Nazca-Pacific boundaries than does NUVEL-1A, consistent with a
progressive slowdown in the eastward component of Nazca plate motion since 3.16 Ma. It also indicates that motions across the Caribbean-North America and Caribbean-South America plate boundaries are twice as fast as given by NUVEL-1A. Summed, least-squares differences between angular velocities estimated from GPS and those for MORVEL, NUVEL-1 and NUVEL-1A are, respectively, 260 per cent larger for NUVEL-1 and 50 per cent larger for NUVEL-1A than for MORVEL, suggesting that MORVEL more
accurately describes historically current plate motions. Significant differences between geological and GPS estimates of Nazca plate motion and Arabia-Eurasia and India-Eurasia motion are reduced but not
eliminated when using MORVEL instead of NUVEL-1A, possibly indicating that changes have occurred in those plate motions since 3.16 Ma. The MORVEL and GPS estimates of Pacific-North America plate motion in western North America differ by only 2.6 +/- 1.7mmyr-1, {\textasciitilde}25
per cent smaller than for NUVEL-1A. The remaining difference for this plate pair, assuming there are no unrecognized systematic errors and no measurable change in Pacific-North America motion over the past 1-3 Myr, indicates deformation of one or more plates in the global circuit. Tests for closure of six three-plate circuits indicate that two,
Pacific-Cocos-Nazca and Sur-Nubia-Antarctic, fail closure, with
respective linear velocities of non-closure of 14 +/- 5 and 3 +/- 1mmyr-1 (95 per cent confidence limits) at their triple
junctions. We conclude that the rigid plate approximation continues to be tremendously useful, but-absent any unrecognized systematic
errors-the plates deform measurably, possibly by thermal contraction and wide plate boundaries with deformation rates near or beneath the level of noise in plate kinematic data.},

It is among the most diverse molecular mixtures known, consisting of millions of individual compounds. More than 1¬†Eg of this material exists on the planet. As such, it comprises a formidable source of natural products promising significant potential for new biotechnological purposes. Great emphasis has been placed on understanding the role of DOM in biogeochemical cycles and climate attenuation, its lifespan, interaction with microorganisms, as well as its molecular composition. Yet, probing DOM bioactivities is in its infancy, largely because it is technically challenging due to the chemical complexity of the material. It is of considerable interest to develop technologies capable to better discern DOM bioactivities. Modern screening technologies are opening new avenues allowing accelerated identification of bioactivities for small molecules from natural products. These methods diminish a priori the need for laborious chemical fractionation. We examine here the application of untargeted metabolomics and multiplexed high-throughput molecular-phenotypic screening techniques that are providing first insights on previously undetectable DOM bioactivities.},

	abstract = {Because riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been considered less bioavailable to coastal bacteria than marine DOM produced by marine phytoplankton, nutrient regeneration from riverine DOM through marine bacterial decomposition has rarely been quantified, especially in eutrophic coastal seas. Through incubation experiments, this study aimed to compare nutrient regeneration from the decomposition of riverine and marine high-molecular-weight (HMW) DOM by coastal bacteria in a eutrophic coastal sea, namely the Ariake Sea in Japan. As an indicator of the bioavailability of DOM, carbon contained in total dissolved amino acids relative to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was higher in marine HMW-DOM than riverine HMW-DOM in July and August, although the opposite pattern was observed in September. Another indicator of the bioavailability of DOM, the degradation index of amino acids, showed more fresh organic matter in riverine HMW-DOM than marine HMW-DOM in August and September. These results suggest that the bioavailability of HMW-DOM was comparable between the river site and marine site. NH4+ and PO43‚àí were released in seawater incubations treated with both riverine and marine HMW-DOM. In addition, amount of riverine DOC decomposition and NH4+ and PO43‚àí regeneration in this study were higher than those in other eutrophic sea. In July, NH4+ and PO43‚àí significantly increased in the riverine HMW-DOM treatment, despite slow DOC decomposition. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that riverine DOM may be comparable to marine DOM as a source of nutrients in a eutrophic coastal ecosystem. In addition, the western Ariake Sea is one of the most serious red tides area, though NH4+ is always (NO3‚àí‚ÄØ+‚ÄØNO2‚àí is occasionally) depleted. Thus, NH4+ supply through riverine DOM degradation may contribute to prolong red tides in this area.},

Using novel molecular characterization approaches and photochemical degradation experiments we studied how seasonal patterns in water column stratification affected the DOM in a Swedish lake under early spring and summer conditions. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were consistently higher above the sediment when compared to surface waters throughout the sampling periods. Photobleaching alone could not explain this difference in DOC because the lake was covered by 40 cm-thick ice during late winter sampling and still showed the same DOC trend. The differences in the molecular diversity between surface DOM in winter and summer were consistent with ongoing photobleaching/decarboxylation and a possible bacterial consumption of photo-products. Additional photo-degradation experiments using simulated sunlight showed a production of highly oxidized organic molecules and low molecular weight compounds in all late winter samples and also in the deep water sample in summer. In the surface summer DOM sample, few such molecules were produced during the photo-degradation experiments, confirming that DOM was already photobleached prior to the experiments. This study suggests that photobleaching, and therefore also the ice cover during winter, plays a central role in surface DOM transformation, with important differences in the molecular composition of DOM between surface and deep boreal lake waters. The release of DOC from boreal lake sediments also contribute to this pattern. Photochemical degradation of DOM may be more extensive following ice-out and water column turnover when non-light exposed and thereby photosensitive DOM is photo-mineralized. Hence, the yearly DOM photo-mineralization may be greater than inferred from studies of recently light-exposed DOM.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Differences between BATS and HOT were principally related to location-speciÔ¨Åc biogeochemical processes and water mass ventilation ages. Concentrations of amino acids, neutral sugar and amino sugars in unÔ¨Åltered seawater sharply declined with depth at both stations, indicating an upper ocean source and rapid turnover of these components. The size distribution of organic matter was heavily skewed to smaller molecular sizes. Depth comparisons showed that larger size classes of organic matter were more efÔ¨Åciently removed than smaller size classes. Carbon-normalized yields of amino acids, neutral sugars and amino sugars decreased rapidly with depth and molecular size. Together these biochemicals accounted for 55\% of organic carbon in surface POM but only 2\% of the organic carbon in LMW DOM in deep water. Chemical compositions showed distinct differences between organic matter size classes indicating the extent of diagenetic processing increased with decreasing molecular size. These Ô¨Åndings are consistent with the size-reactivity continuum model for organic matter in which bioreactivity decreases with decreasing molecular size and diagenetic processes lead to the formation of smaller components that are resistant to biodegradation. The data also provided evidence for a size-composition continuum. Carbon-normalized yields of amino acids, neutral sugars and amino sugars were sensitive indicators of diagenetic alterations. Diagenetic indicators based on amino acid compositions revealed distinct patterns for the North PaciÔ¨Åc and Sargasso Sea possibly indicating the inÔ¨Çuence of varying sources or diagenetic processing.},

In contrast, the vast majority of DON, especially in the deep ocean, resides in the form of nitrogenous substances that are resistant to biological degradation. These substances, which represent an enormous reservoir of fixed nitrogen, are not readily identified by conventional biochemical techniques, but have been assumed to consist largely of structurally complex macromolecules resulting from the degradation and spontaneous abiotic condensation of biochemical precursors6. Here we present 15N NMR measurements that contradict this view. Our results show that most higher-molecular-weight DON in the ocean exists in amide form, rather than as a collection of nitrogen heterocycles that might be indicative of spontaneous condensation products. Because these amides are unlikely to form abiotically, the bulk of the ocean's DON reservoir appears to derive directly from degradation-resistant biomolecules.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter affects fundamental biogeochemical processes in the soil such as nutrient cycling and organic matter storage. The current paradigm is that processing of dissolved organic matter converges to recalcitrant molecules (those that resist degradation) of low molecular mass and high molecular diversity through biotic and abiotic processes. Here we demonstrate that the molecular composition and properties of dissolved organic matter continuously change during soil passage and propose that this reflects a continual shifting of its sources. Using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we studied the molecular changes of dissolved organic matter from the soil surface to 60‚Äâcm depth in 20 temperate grassland communities in soil type Eutric Fluvisol. Applying a semi-quantitative approach, we observed that plant-derived molecules were first broken down into molecules containing a large proportion of low-molecular-mass compounds. These low-molecular-mass compounds became less abundant during soil passage, whereas larger molecules, depleted in plant-related ligno-cellulosic structures, became more abundant. These findings indicate that the small plant-derived molecules were preferentially consumed by microorganisms and transformed into larger microbial-derived molecules. This suggests that dissolved organic matter is not intrinsically recalcitrant but instead persists in soil as a result of simultaneous consumption, transformation and formation.},

Carbon-normalized yields of lignin and Œ¥13C measurements indicate that while terrigenous organic matter accounts only for ‚àº1\% of DOM in seawater, submicron POM has a substantial terrigenous component. The apparent size distribution and terrigenous nature of the particles is consistent with an aerosol source, but these particles could also be delivered to the ocean via rivers. Ratios of syringyl to vanillyl phenols as well as the fraction of dissolved lignin in HMW DOM provide molecular evidence of photochemical oxidation. Several differences in lignin composition and concentrations were evident between water masses. In particular, concentrations in North Pacific Intermediate Water were a factor of two greater than at all other depths. This is likely a reflection of higher riverine input via the Sea of Okhotsk. These trends suggest that lignin could serve as a general circulation tracer in addition to tracing riverine input and diagenetic processing of terrigenous organic matter in the ocean.},

	abstract = {Characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in terms of its composition and optical properties, with an eye toward ultimately understanding its deep ocean dynamics, is the currently active frontier in DOM research. We used UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy to characterize DOM in the open ocean along sections of the U.S. CO2/CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography Project located in all the major ocean basins outside the Arctic. Despite large differences in fluorescence intensity between ocean basins, some variability patterns were similar throughout the global ocean, suggesting similar processes controlling the composition of the DOM. We find that commercially available single channel CDOM sensors are sensitive to the fluorescence of humic materials in the deep ocean and thermocline but not to the UVA-fluorescing and absorbing materials that characterize freshly produced CDOM in surface waters, revealing fundamental diversity in the DOM profile. In surface waters, UVA fluorescence and absorption signatures indicate the presence of freshly produced material and the process of bleaching removal, but in the upper mesopelagic and in the main thermocline these optical signatures are replaced by those of humic materials, with distribution patterns correlated to apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) and other signatures of remineralization. Empirical orthogonal function analysis (EOF) of the EEM data suggests the presence of two (unidentified) processes which convert ‚Äúfresh‚Äù DOM to humic materials: one located in the surface ocean (shallower than 500 m) and one located in the main thermocline. These inferred humification processes represent less than 5\% of the overall variability in oceanic humic DOM fluorescence, which appears to be dominated by terrestrial input and solar bleaching of humic materials.},

In this study, we investigated the dissolved organic matter (DOM) of porewater in a MV in the Canadian Beaufort Sea and compared dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and fluorescent DOM (FDOM) between the MV and a reference site (RS). The chemical and isotopic compositions (Cl‚àí, Œ¥18O and Œ¥D) of porewater from the MVs indicated that these fluids are derived from a mixture of seawater, meteoric water, and clay dehydration, causing a freshening of the porewaters. Interestingly, the porewaters in the MV exhibited DOC concentrations up to 14 times higher than those in the RS. This high DOC concentration was attributed to a higher concentration in the deep fluid moving upwards through the MV, and in minor part to processes such as particulate organic matter sulfate reduction, anaerobic oxidation of methane and higher biological activity in the MV sediments. The fluorescence results showed the presence of four components in both MV and RS sites, which included two humic-like, one microbial humic-like, and a protein-like component. All the four fluorescent components increased with depth, showing a good linear relationship with DOC. However, the DOC-normalized fluorescence in the porewater DOM was on average 3 to 7 times lower in the MV, suggesting that the DOM molecules have undergone thermogenic processes in the deep sediments, and that shallow processes do not affect significantly the FDOM composition. Our results highlight that fluids migrating from the deep sediment through the MV can be an important source of thermogenically altered DOM to the shallow sediments and overlaying water column.},

On average, 63\% of added carbon and 68\% of added nitrogen were removed within the Ô¨Årst 30 days of decomposition. In all cases, amino acid utilization accounted for a substantial fraction of the removed C and N. Carbon-normalized amino acid yields decreased to less than 50\% of their starting values and most of this change occurred within the Ô¨Årst 10 days of decomposition. Increases in the concentrations of amino sugars and decreases in the GlcN:GalN ratio in particulate organic matter (POM) illustrated the signiÔ¨Åcance of microbial production during the decomposition of added substrates. Changes in the mol \% composition of amino acids during early diagenesis were substantial but highly variable with substrate. Previous survey data collected from the same region were used in conjunction with the experimental data to investigate the utility of several established amino acid-based indices of organic matter diagenesis. This comparison showed that a combination of these degradation indexes is most effective for describing the diagenetic state of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Carbon-normalized amino acid yields were found to be the most effective indicator for early diagenesis. Relative abundances of amino acids were effective indicators of intermediate stages of diagenesis and the mol \% composition of the non-protein amino acid c-Aba (c-aminobutyric acid) was an effective indicator of advanced DOM diagenesis.},

In contrast to POM, DOM lignin phenol concentrations were {\textasciitilde}2-fold higher in the Atlantic, with more than two thirds in the high-molecular weight (HMW; N1 kDa) fraction.

Concentrations of dissolved lignin phenols in polar surface waters are 7-fold to 16-fold higher than those in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and stable carbon isotopic compositions of DOM are depleted in 13C by 1‚Äì2‚Ä∞ relative to those in the Atlantic and Pacific. The large contribution of terrigenous DOM from Arctic rivers is responsible for the elevated concentrations of DOC in polar surface waters. The distribution of terrigenous DOM in polar surface waters is very heterogeneous, but on average we estimate 14‚Äì24\% of the DOC is of terrestrial origin. Stable nitrogen isotopic compositions were useful for distinguishing DOM of Pacific and Atlantic origins as well as terrigenous and marine origins. The size distribution and composition of lignin phenols provide some evidence of photochemical transformations of terrigenous DOM, but it appears this process is not extensive in polar surface waters. The extent to which terrigenous DOM is removed from the Arctic Ocean by microbial degradation is less clear and warrants further study. Physical transport of terrigenous DOC to the North Atlantic is a major mechanism for its removal from the Arctic. The East Greenland Current alone exports 4.4‚Äì6.6 Tg of terrigenous DOC annually to the North Atlantic. Terrigenous DOC of Arctic origin was identified for the first time in components of North Atlantic Deep Water. Preliminary estimates indicate that ‚àº1 Tg of terrigenous DOC is exported from the Arctic in Denmark Strait Overflow Water with an additional ‚àº0.7 Tg in Classical Labrador Sea Water. Together, these exports compose approximately 25‚Äì33\% of the terrigenous DOC discharged annually to the Arctic via rivers.},

This review is not meant to be an exhaustive survey of total DON composition but a focused report on more recent analytical advances in the study of complex DON compounds. The compositional information provided by these studies is further interpreted in the context of sources and sinks for particular organic N compounds in the marine environment. The discussion on the chemical composition of DON in seawater demonstrates that bulk analytical methods, for instance bulk stable isotope measurements, elemental analysis, 1H-, 13C-, and 15N-NMR spectroscopy, have made significant progress in identifying and quantifying various components of this N reservoir. However, molecular level investigations are required before definitive sources and sinks for these molecules can be identified in the marine environment.},

Non-axenic monocultures of Attheya septentrionalis and Nitzschia frigida and a natural ice algal assemblage (NIAA) were grown at 4 \&deg;C in an f/2 medium under cool white fluorescent light. Culture samples were collected several days apart throughout the exponential, stationary, and senescent phases, and analyzed for CDOM absorbance, chlorophyll a, and bacterial cell abundance. The cultures displayed apparent specific growth rates of algal and bacterial cells comparable to those in the field.

The senescent-phase production rate for NIAA was {\textasciitilde}40\% higher than that for A. septentrionalis. The chlorophyll a-normalized CDOM production rates in the cultures are comparable to those reported for Arctic first-year sea ice. The absorption spectra of CDOM in the cultures exhibited characteristic short-ultraviolet shoulders similar to those previously identified in sea ice.

Sea-ice DOM concentrations in this productive region averaged nearly 2000 ¬µmol l-1 in May 2011 and 2012. The abundance, activity (high [HNA] versus low [LNA] nucleic acid cells) and apparent size of surface water prokaryotes were quantified along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved nitrogen (DN) concentrations during the experiments. Following a 4 d lag, prokaryotic abundance increased more than 30√ó in the time-series enrichment experiment and the proportion of HNA cells increased from 60 to {\textgreater}99\% of total prokaryote abundance. DOM dose-response experiments conducted in 2011 and 2012 yielded prokaryotic growth rate estimates between 0.35 and 0.67 d-1 in response to the addition of sea-ice DOM. On average, 20\% of the sea-ice DOC pool was utilized by the surface water prokaryotes and the observed increase in cell abundance and individual cell size indicated a release from carbon limitation of initial in situ conditions. Prokaryotic growth yields ranged from 0.02 to 0.07 cell ¬µmol l-1 DOC and 0.01 to 0.06 cell ¬µmol l-1 DN and experimental conditions shifted from net autotrophic to net heterotrophic. Heterotrophic activity at the ice-water boundary layer upon the release of labile first-year ice DOM is likely to impact current and future carbon flux estimates as seasonal ice becomes the predominant ice type in the Arctic.},

CDOM was the optically dominant component of non-water absorption, increasing the energy absorption and heating potential in the top 8m by 30\% over pure seawater. CDOM absorption within sea ice brine channels increased with solar-stimulated ice algae production. This ice algal mediated production of CDOM exceeded photooxidation rates, potentiating a net delivery of CDOM to the immediately underlying water column from brine channels in the ice. The rates of production and loss of CDOM in Arctic waters during the early spring quantified here will help constrain a major uncertainty in modeling light absorption by surface waters that contributes to sea ice loss in the Arctic.},

	abstract = {Shallow submarine hydrothermal systems are extreme environments with unique biogeochemical conditions, originating from the interaction of hot, reduced Ô¨Çuids and cold, oxygenated seawater. Hydrothermal Ô¨Çuids represent one of the marine sources of essential trace elements like iron, the Ô¨Çux of which is controlled by dissolved organic matter (DOM) in and between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. However, the selectivity of the DOM with iron in marine environments is not well understood. Here we characterized at a molecular level the marine hydrothermal iron‚ÄìDOM interaction using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Our study site was a shallow-water hydrothermal system off Dominica Island (Lesser Antilles, Caribbean Sea), where reduced Ô¨Çuids were strongly enriched in dissolved Fe and Si as compared to surface seawater. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was lower in the hydrothermal Ô¨Çuids, most likely due to low-DOC meteoric water inÔ¨Çuence, but also suggesting biotic or abiotic processes consuming or depleting DOC when seawater is re-circulated through the sediment. The formation of hydrous ferric oxides upon aeration of the hydrothermal Ô¨Çuids for 10 h leads to an 8\% decrease in DOC, indicating co-precipitation of iron and DOM. Resolubilization of iron precipitates revealed increased relative abundance of aromatic compounds in coprecipitated DOM, which is in accordance with iron-coagulation observed in terrestrial environments. In conclusion, we provide evidence of co-precipitation of DOM with iron at hydrothermal systems as a selective process, which characteristically alters the molecular composition of DOM released with hydrothermal Ô¨Çuids.},

Formate (36‚Äì158 lmol/kg) and acetate (1‚Äì35 lmol/kg) concentrations are higher than in other Ô¨Çuids from unsedimented hydrothermal vents, and are a higher ratio of the total dissolved organic carbon than has been found in most marine geothermal systems. Isotopic evidence is consistent with an abiotic formation mechanism for formate, perhaps during serpentinization processes in the sub-surface. Further support comes from previous studies where the abiological formation of low molecular weight organic acids has been shown to be thermodynamically favorable during hydrothermal alteration of olivine, and laboratory studies in which the reduction of carbon dioxide to formate has been conÔ¨Årmed. As the second most prevalent carbon species after methane, formate may be an important substrate to microbial communities in an environment where dissolved inorganic carbon is limited. Acetate is found in locations where sulfate reduction is believed to be important and is likely to be a microbial by-product, formed either directly by autotrophic metabolic activity or indirectly during the fermentative degradation of larger organic molecules. Given the common occurrence of exposed ultramaÔ¨Åc rocks and active serpentinization within the worlds ocean basins, the abiotic formation of formate may be an important process supporting life in these high pH environments and may have critical implications to understanding the organic precursors from which life evolved.},

Although dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents an important resource for soil microorganisms, knowledge of how its quality affects microbial biogeography is limited. Here, we characterized soil bacterial communities and DOM quality in 45 soil samples collected from a 1500-km sampling transect through semi-arid regions in northern China which are currently suffering great pressure from climate change, using Illumina Miseq sequencing and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively. We found that DOM quality (i.e. the source of DOM and the humification degree of DOM) had profound shaping influence on the biogeographic patterns exhibited by bacterial diversity, community composition and association networks. Specifically, the composition of bacteria community closely associated with DOM quality. Plant-derived DOM sustained higher bacterial diversity relative to microbial-derived DOM. Meanwhile, bacterial diversity linearly increased with increasing humification degree of DOM. Additionally, plant-derived DOM was observed to foster more complex bacterial association networks with less competition. Together, our work contributes to the factors underlying biogeographic patterns not only of bacterial diversity, community composition but also of their association networks and reports previously undocumented important role of DOM quality in shaping these patterns.},

Because DOM represents a complex mixture of millions of different compounds, the statistical analysis of DOM dynamics poses a huge challenge. Here, we present a statistical approach based on hierarchical clustering of time series that groups DOM compounds with synchronous dynamics. We applied this approach to time series of Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry data of DOM sampled over a period of 26 months near Helgoland, an island in the Southern North Sea. We identified three DOM clusters, which represented a total of 1392 different molecular formulae and showed distinct chemical properties and noticeably compound matches within the PubChem database. Correlations of the three DOM clusters with abundance data of prokaryote and phytoplankton species and with environmental parameters provided consistent indications on the potential origin of the clustered compounds. The first cluster integrated terrestrial DOM originating from riverine discharge reaching Helgoland waters. The second cluster was attributed to DOM related to phytoplankton and microbial activity, whereas the third cluster was interpreted as representing the marine refractory DOM background. Accordingly, while further partitioning divided each of the first two clusters into five sub-clusters with distinct temporal dynamics and molecular characteristics, the third cluster persisted as a stable feature. Applying a purely mathematical approach, we thus confirmed the differential dynamics of individual DOM compounds and compound groups and showed that temporal dynamics of dissolved molecules are linked to their origin and transformation history.},

Because no modern-day terrestrial hydrothermal systems are free from the inÔ¨Çuence of organic compounds derived from biologic processes, laboratory experiments provide the best opportunity for conÔ¨Årmation of the potential for organic synthesis in hydrothermal systems. Here we report on the formation of lipid compounds during Fischer-Tropsch-type synthesis from aqueous solutions of formic acid or oxalic acid. Optimum synthesis occurs in stainless steel vessels by heating at 175 ‚ó¶C for 2‚Äì3 days and produces lipid compounds ranging from C2 to {\textgreater}C35 which consist of n-alkanols, n-alkanoic acids, n-alkenes, nalkanes and alkanones. The precursor carbon sources used are either formic acid or oxalic acid, which disproportionate to H2, CO2 and probably CO. Both carbon sources yield the same lipid classes with essentially the same ranges of compounds. The synthesis reactions were conÔ¨Årmed by using 13C labeled precursor acids.},

The major amount of the extractable organic matter from the sulfides consists of normal and branched alkanes, UCM, PAHs, terpenoids, and fatty acids. The branched alkanes are comprised of unique gem-diethylalkane series, possibly from sulfide oxidizing bacteria, and biphytanes from archaea. The characteristic lipid and biomarker compounds found in the hydrothermal samples support a predominantly biological origin of the bitumens from the thermal transformation of the biomass of microorganisms (bacteria and archea) and minor macrofauna of this vent field. A search for molecular evidence for abiogenic thermocatalytic synthesis of organic compounds was negative. However, methane in the hydrothermal fluids and possibly a minor amount of the alkanes in the sulfides may be of an abiogenic origin in the Rainbow vent field.},

Estimates of the total number of vent fields and associated mineral deposits, based on plume studies and deposit occurrence models, range from 500 to 5000. We have used new deposit occurrence data from 10,000 km of ridge, arc, and backarc spreading centers to estimate the amount of massive sulfide in the easily accessible neovolcanic zones of the global oceans.

Current research seeks to understand the relationship of the ocean's biological pump to the Earth's environmental, chemical, and climatic history. Changes in the efficiency of the biological pump are central to most current hypotheses for the cause of the coherent variations of atmospheric CO2 over the ice age climate cycles (i.e., glacial vs. interglacial stages). Here, we review the concepts, tools, and observations relating to this topic. While the biological pump is driven by biological activity in the sunlit surface ocean, its global efficiency is shown to be affected by the ocean's physical circulation, and its net effect on atmospheric CO2 is shown to work through the ocean's acid‚Äìbase chemistry. We integrate these findings into a proposed recipe for the major dynamics driving CO2 change over the past 800000 years.},

	abstract = {The two main observations characterising marine and lacustrine methane macro-seeps are ebullition through holes in the sea- or lake-bed, and hydroacoustic ‚Äúflares‚Äù in the water column. This paper reviews multi-year, multi-scale, and multi-discipline results from three seep locations in the North Sea and combines the knowledge with recent seafloor and water column results from seeps in the Santa Barbara basin, California, a seep off West Africa, seeps in the Gulf of Mexico, and in Lake Baikal, Russia. We have identified a total of 12 characteristics of methane and minor oil macro-seeps that are not only geological in nature, but also biological and geochemical. These are shown to impact the marine environment in different ways, not least in benefactory manners, as primary producers (mainly bacteria and archaea) tend to bloom during seepage. Therefore, the seepage is inferred to have a fertilizing effect on both the seafloor and the water column, which may be of broad ecological and biological significance. The study concludes with a holistic conceptual seep-model which is expected to be of interest to a broad range of researchers in the fields of oceanography and limnology.},

	abstract = {Earth history is punctuated by a huge variety of transitions and perturbations in climate and global biogeochemical cycles. Some of these events exhibit evidence for greenhouse warming and CO2 release and hence potentially provide clues regarding future changes. Negative spikes and transients in the isotopic composition of carbon in sedimentary rocks bear the testimony of these carbon cycle perturbations and are generally taken to indicate the introduction of carbon with a relatively depleted isotopic signature into the ocean and atmosphere. One reservoir of isotopically depleted carbon is the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) present in the ocean. This has led to the idea that both the cycling of DOC and its reservoir size could have been fundamentally different in the past and that change in the oceanic DOC cycle may be mechanistically linked to major events in the geological record. This chapter provides an overview of how the proposed link between DOC and major global carbon cycle perturbation events in the geological record arises. We start by presenting a summary of the traditional view of how the marine carbon cycle operates. We then introduce how the geological record is interpreted, focusing on the ways in which the carbon isotopic signature of sedimentary rocks reflects past changes in global carbon cycling. We go on to critically assess recent thinking on the potential role of DOC as a driver for extreme climate events before touching on the future implications of a DOC cycle active on geological timescales.},

In situ campaigns provide valuable datasets to reduce these uncertainties. Here we analyse data from the summer 2014 SWERUS-C3 campaign in the eastern Arctic Ocean, off the shore of Siberia and Alaska. Total concentrations of methane, as well as relative concentrations of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{12}}$CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{13}}$CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, were measured continuously during this campaign for 35\&thinsp;d in July and August. Using a chemistry-transport model, we link observed concentrations and isotopic ratios to regional emissions and hemispheric transport structures. A simple inversion system helped constrain source signatures from wetlands in Siberia and Alaska, and oceanic sources, as well as the isotopic composition of lower-stratosphere air masses. The variation in the signature of lower-stratosphere air masses, due to strongly fractionating chemical reactions in the stratosphere, was suggested to explain a large share of the observed variability in isotopic ratios. These results point towards necessary efforts to better simulate large-scale transport and chemistry patterns to make relevant use of isotopic data in remote areas. It is also found that constant and homogeneous source signatures for each type of emission in a given region (mostly wetlands and oil and gas industry in our case at high latitudes) are not compatible with the strong synoptic isotopic signal observed in the Arctic. A regional gradient in source signatures is highlighted between Siberian and Alaskan wetlands, the latter having lighter signatures (more depleted in {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{13}}$C{\textless}/span{\textgreater}). Finally, our results suggest that marine emissions of methane from Arctic continental-shelf sources are dominated by thermogenic-origin methane, with a secondary biogenic source as well.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This is close to the source signature of CH4 emissions from boreal wetlands.

Emissions of CH4 to the water column from the seabed on the Spitsbergen continental slope are occurring but none has yet been detected reaching the atmosphere.

	abstract = {Methane concentration and isotopic composition was measured in ice-covered and ice-free waters of the Arctic Ocean during 11 surveys spanning the years of 1992‚Äì1995 and 2009. During ice-free periods, methane flux from the Beaufort shelf varies from 0.14 mg CH4 m‚àí2 d‚àí1 to 0.43 mg CH4 m‚àí2 d‚àí1. Maximum fluxes from localized areas of high methane concentration are up to 1.52 mg CH4 m‚àí2 d‚àí1. Seasonal buildup of methane under ice can produce short-term fluxes of methane from the Beaufort shelf that varies from 0.28 mg CH4 m‚àí2 d‚àí1 to 1.01 mg CH4 m‚àí2 d‚àí1. Scaled-up estimates of minimum methane flux from the Beaufort Sea and pan-Arctic shelf for both ice-free and ice-covered periods range from 0.02 Tg CH4 yr‚àí1 and 0.30 Tg CH4 yr‚àí1, respectively to maximum fluxes of 0.18 Tg CH4 yr‚àí1 and 2.2 Tg CH4 yr‚àí1, respectively. A methane flux of 0.36 Tg CH4 yr‚àí1 from the deep Arctic Ocean was estimated using data from 1993 to 1994. The flux can be as much as 2.35 Tg CH4 yr‚àí1 estimated from maximum methane concentrations and wind speeds of 12 m/s, representing only 0.42\% of the annual atmospheric methane budget of ‚àº 560 Tg CH4 yr‚àí1. There were no significant changes in methane fluxes during the time period of this study. Microbial methane sources predominate with minor influxes from thermogenic methane offshore Prudhoe Bay and the Mackenzie River delta and may include methane from gas hydrate. Methane oxidation is locally important on the shelf and is a methane sink in the deep Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {Recent Arctic warming and decreasing sea-ice can promote the release of methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas, from the Arctic Ocean, thereby providing a strong climate feedback. However, the dynamics of dissolved CH4 in the Arctic Ocean remain uncertain, especially in western areas. This report describes the horizontal and vertical distributions of concentration and stable carbon isotope ratio (Œ¥13C value) of CH4 in the western Arctic Ocean. Surface layer samples used for this study were supersaturated with CH4 in comparison to the atmosphere. Especially high CH4 concentrations (up to 10.3¬†nmol¬†kg‚àí1) were observed at stations in the continental shelf area. At the bottom layer of the shelf stations, the CH4 concentration was higher (up to 55.9¬†nmol¬†kg‚àí1). Its Œ¥13C value was lower (down to ‚àí¬†63.8‚Ä∞) than in the surface layer, which suggests that CH4 in the shelf water is produced mainly by methanogens in sediment. At deeper stations in the Canada Basin (seafloor¬†{\textgreater}¬†300¬†m depth), the maxima of CH4 concentration were detected at depths of 10‚Äì50¬†m and 100‚Äì200¬†m, although Œ¥13C values were lowest at 50¬†m depth. The shallower CH4 maximum coincided with the DO maximum, suggesting CH4 production by plankton activity or sinking particles. The deeper CH4 maximum corresponded to the nutrient maximum, suggesting horizontal advection of shelf water from the coastal shelf area. From the results, we were able to confirm that the dynamics of dissolved CH4 in the western Arctic Ocean in summer 2012 varied with area and depth.},

	abstract = {Marine cyanobacteria play an important role in trace metal cycling in the oceans. However, the influence of bacterial detritus following cell lysis - that includes both particulate organic matter (POM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) - is less understood. Previous investigations have shown that the ratio of bacterial detritus to living cells increases significantly with ocean depth, indicating that the former plays a central role in trace metal cycling and eventual sequestration in deep marine sediments. Thus, in this study we produced detritus from the mechanical lysis of the common marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (referred to as cyPOM and cyDOM), and then measured their buffering capacity through proton adsorption and release via potentiometric acid-base titrations. Both cyPOM and cyDOM were best modelled using a 2-site non-electrostatic protonation model. The cyPOM fraction possessed ligands with pKa values of 5.78 (¬±0.07) and 9.01 (¬±0.29) with corresponding site concentrations of 41.8 (¬±8.15) ¬µmol g-1 and 41.2 (¬±5.28) ¬µmol g-1, while cyDOM had pKa values of 4.89 (¬±0.22) and 6.80 (¬±0.22) and corresponding site concentrations of 42.8 (¬±14.6) ¬µmol g-1 and 37.3 (¬±16.5) ¬µmol g-1. As a comparison, intact Synechococcus cells were previously reported to be best modelled by invoking 3-sites with overall ligand densities more than double that of cyPOM and cyDOM. Trace metal (Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, and Zn) adsorption experiments indicate that cyPOM has a lower affinity towards trace metals than intact Synechococcus cells, evidenced by lower trace metals adsorption per gram of dry mass and therefore less trace metal sequestration potential. This implies that intact Synechococcus cells are chiefly responsible for trace metal sequestration, even at high cyPOM proportions (10:1 ‚Äì cyPOM:Synechococcus) that are more representative of POM that reaches the seafloor. The cyDOM-trace metal association could not be determined experimentally; thus we applied existing thermodynamic data from modern marine DOM studies acquired via potentiometric titrations and metal-binding constants. Unlike cyPOM, metal speciation is almost entirely accounted for in the dissolved fraction ({\textgreater}99.9\%). These results further the view that DOM is the most important microbial fraction in controlling metals speciation in the water column.},

	abstract = {The Arctic is undergoing unprecedented environmental change. Rapid warming, decline in sea ice extent, increase in riverine input, ocean acidification and changes in primary productivity are creating a crucible for multiple concurrent environmental stressors, with unknown consequences for the entire arctic ecosystem. Here, we synthesized 30¬†years of data on the stable carbon isotope (Œ¥13C) signatures in dissolved inorganic carbon (Œ¥13C‚ÄêDIC; 1977‚Äì2014), marine and riverine particulate organic carbon (Œ¥13C‚ÄêPOC; 1986‚Äì2013) and tissues of marine mammals in the Arctic. Œ¥13C values in consumers can change as a result of environmentally driven variation in the Œ¥13C values at the base of the food web or alteration in the trophic structure, thus providing a method to assess the sensitivity of food webs to environmental change. Our synthesis reveals a spatially heterogeneous and temporally evolving Œ¥13C baseline, with spatial gradients in the Œ¥13C‚ÄêPOC values between arctic shelves and arctic basins likely driven by differences in productivity and riverine and coastal influence. We report a decline in Œ¥13C‚ÄêDIC values (‚àí0.011‚Ä∞ per year) in the Arctic, reflecting increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Arctic Ocean (i.e. Suess effect), which is larger than predicted. The larger decline in Œ¥13C‚ÄêPOC values and Œ¥13C in arctic marine mammals reflects the anthropogenic CO2 signal as well as the influence of a changing arctic environment. Combining the influence of changing sea ice conditions and isotopic fractionation by phytoplankton, we explain the decadal decline in Œ¥13C‚ÄêPOC values in the Arctic Ocean and partially explain the Œ¥13C values in marine mammals with consideration of time‚Äêvarying integration of Œ¥13C values. The response of the arctic ecosystem to ongoing environmental change is stronger than we would predict theoretically, which has tremendous implications for the study of food webs in the rapidly changing Arctic Ocean., Warming of the Arctic has led to changes in multiple environmental factors that control the carbon isotope ratio at the base of the food web. Here, we present the first comprehensive spatial and temporal assessment of the carbon isotopic baseline for the Arctic Ocean, which is essential for understanding and predicting changes in Arctic food web structure. The response of the Arctic ecosystem to ongoing environmental change presented here is stronger than we would predict theoretically.},

Annual NPP increased 30\% over the Arctic Ocean during our study period, with the largest increases on the interior shelves and smaller increases on inflow shelves. Increased annual NPP was often, but not always, associated with reduced sea-ice extent and a longer phytoplankton growing season (fewer days of ice cover). Spatial patterns of increased annual NPP suggest that increased nutrient fluxes may also play an important role. Outflow shelves either exhibited no change in annual NPP during our study period or a significant decline, perhaps indicating that nutrients had been consumed by increased NPP farther upstream.},

It is of significance to clarify their relationship and better understand the contribution of gas hydrate systems or the deeper hydrocarbon reservoirs for methane flux leaking to the seawater or even the atmosphere by natural seepages at the seabed. In this paper, a geophysical examination of the global seabed methane seepage events has been conducted, and nearby gas hydrate stability zone and relevant fluid migration pathways have been interpreted or modelled using seismic data, multibeam data, or underwater photos. Results show that seabed methane seepage sites are often manifested as methane flares, pockmarks, deep-water corals, authigenic carbonates, and gas hydrate pingoes at the seabed, most of which are closely related to vertical fluid migration structures like faults, gas chimneys, mud volcanoes, and unconformity surfaces or are located in the landward limit of gas hydrate stability zone (LLGHSZ) where hydrate dissociation may have released a great volume of methane. Based on a comprehensive analysis of these features, three major types of seabed methane seepage are classified according to their spatial relationship with the location of LLGHSZ, deeper than the LLGHSZ (A), around the LLGHSZ (B), and shallower than LLGHSZ (C). These three seabed methane seepage types can be further divided into five subtypes considering whether the gas source of seabed methane seepage is from the gas hydrate systems or not. We propose subtype B2 represents the most important seabed methane seepage type due to the high density of seepage sites and large volume of released methane from massive focused vigorous methane seepage sites around the LLGHSZ. Based on the classification result of this research, more measures should be taken for subtype B2 seabed methane seepage to predict or even prevent ocean warming or climate change.},

	abstract = {Sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) limits the release of methane from marine sediments and promotes the formation of carbonates close to the seafloor in seepage areas along continental margins. It has been established that hydrocarbon seeps are a source of methane, dissolved inorganic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon to marine environments. However, questions remain about the contribution of deep-sourced carbon from hydrocarbon seeps to the sedimentary organic carbon pool. In this study, we analyzed carbon quantity, radiocarbon content (as percent modern carbon, pMC), stable carbon isotopic compositions (as Œ¥13C) of organic matter enclosed within seep carbonates from the Gulf of Mexico and the South China Sea to assess if sediment organic matter may be used as a proxy for methane seepage intensity. The Œ¥13C values of organic matter (Œ¥13Corg) exhibited a large range from ‚àí81.4‚Ä∞ to ‚àí23.9‚Ä∞. Radiocarbon contents of the carbonate-bound organic matter in seep carbonates ranged from 6\% to 28\% pMC, suggesting organic matter of the carbonates is a mixture of marine particulate organic matter (Œ¥13C‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ‚àí22‚Ä∞ VPDB and 90\% modern carbon) and biomass resulting from methane oxidation (assumed to have 0\% modern carbon). Assuming constant productivity in the marine photic zone, it is proposed that seepage intensity and duration are the most important factors controlling the contribution of methane-derived carbon to the sedimentary column. This study reinforces the potential for using Œ¥13C values of organic carbon to discern methane-rich environments in ancient sedimentary environments where authigenic carbonate is not present and to constrain the record of AOM through Earth history.},

The method, based on the reaction of ammonia with orthophtaldialdehyde (OPA) and sulfite, is easy to use, sensitive and highly reproducible. The combination of reagents makes it highly selective, thus eliminating the need for the gas diffusion cell commonly used to remove amino acid interference. Results on kinetics, on reagent composition and light effects and on pH and salinity changes are presented. The salt-effect does not exceed 3\% in the 0‚Äì35 salinity range. Interference from primary amines is {\textless} 0.5\%. Among the naturally occurring inorganic species tested, only sulfide presents a significant, depressive effect. The method can be used in oligotrophic areas (detection limit 1.5 nmol l‚àí1); specific recommendations are provided accordingly. Repeatability of 0.01 Œºmol l‚àí1 was achieved in marine samples with ammonia concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5 Œºmol l‚àí1. Using on-line dilution, ammonia determination can be performed up to 250 Œºmol l‚àí1 and salt effect becomes negligible. Comparison of the present OPA-method with the indophenol blue method yielded fully comparable results.},

In the Arctic Ocean, Œ¥13CDIC values are prone to change in the near future with rapidly changing climate conditions. This study provides a baseline to assess the Œ¥13CDIC of the Arctic Ocean with a focus on upper to intermediate waters (to {\textasciitilde}500¬†m). Measured Œ¥13CDIC values in the Arctic Ocean range from {\textasciitilde}‚àí0.6 to +2.2¬†‚Ä∞. In the Eurasian Basin, the Œ¥13CDIC values lie between {\textasciitilde}1 and 1.5¬†‚Ä∞ and exhibit little variation within the upper layers. In the Canada Basin, Œ¥13CDIC values reach 2¬†‚Ä∞ in the surface layer, with lowest values of {\textasciitilde}‚àí0.6¬†‚Ä∞ found at {\textasciitilde}200¬†m water depth. At greater depth, Œ¥13CDIC values range from {\textasciitilde}1 to 1.5¬†‚Ä∞ within both basins. In the Canada Basin, nutrient levels are higher than in the Eurasian Basin and associated variations in Œ¥13CDIC are clearly related to biological processes. However, low Œ¥13CDIC values in the Canada Basin are also strongly influenced by non-equilibrium air‚Äìsea exchange processes. The different Œ¥13CDIC patterns between the Canada Basin and the Eurasian Basin appear to be linked to differences in transport processes within the Arctic Ocean halocline. The upper layers in the Canada basins have direct contributions of waters from the Laptev, East Siberian and Chukchi shelves, which contain elevated fractions of river waters and sea-ice related brines, whereas their counterparts, in the Eurasian Basin, are mostly formed by halocline waters from the Barents and Kara seas. River waters have low Œ¥13CDIC of {\textasciitilde}‚àí8¬†‚Ä∞ on average, but in the Arctic basins this signal is mostly lost and Œ¥13CDIC values show only a weak correlation to river water fractions contained in the water mass. No relation between Œ¥13CDIC and sea-ice related brine contribution is apparent.},

	abstract = {Distributions of sea-ice melt (SIM) and runoff (RW) were determined in Hudson Bay (Canada) using salinity and oxygen isotope (Œ¥18O) tracers. In late summer/early fall, stations throughout the Bay exhibited a summer surface mixed layer (SSML) 30‚Äì60m deep, which contained the seasonal freshwater inputs. The SSML overlies a cold subsurface water, extending up to 125m deep in the water column, indicative of the previous winter's surface mixed layer (WSML). Our data show that most of the RW remains in a nearshore coastal regime in summer, with limited exchange into the interior of the Bay. At depth, brine (negative SIM) accumulation is closely associated with excess RW, implying that deep water formation occurs when sufficient brine is rejected from the growing ice to overcome RW buoyancy in surface water. The inventory of RW at depths below the WSML is equivalent to almost one year's runoff inputs which, given a residence time of deep water of 4‚Äì14years, implies that 6‚Äì16\% of the annual river discharge is shunted into deeper waters each winter. The balance between the RW buoyancy in surface waters and densification due to ice formation appears to control where and when deep-water formation can occur. Although not directly measured, regions forming deep water are likely small ({\textless}10\% of the Bay area) and associated with flaw leads extending around the perimeter of the landfast ice edge in the Bay. The processes evident in Œ¥18O and salinity data must be incorporated into ocean models to obtain a realistic view of freshwater cycling and its sensitivity to climate perturbations.},

The benefits of finer resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified independently from a reference database. Here we discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of closed-reference OTUs‚Äîincluding computational costs that scale linearly with study size, simple merging between independently processed data sets, and forward prediction‚Äîand of de novo OTUs‚Äîincluding accurate measurement of diversity and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference databases.

In this study, we characterized the porewater DOM composition in a 300-cm sediment core from the Pearl River estuary, China, and examined the interactions between DOM and archaeal and bacterial communities. DOM composition were highly stratified and associated with changing microbial communities. Compared to bacteria, the amplicon sequence variants of archaea showed significant Pearson correlations (r ‚â• 0.65, P {\textless} 0.01) with DOM molecules of low H/C ratios, high C number and double bond equivalents, indicating that the distribution of archaea was closely correlated to recalcitrant DOM while bacteria were associated with relatively labile compounds. This was supported by the presence of auxiliary enzyme families essential for lignin degradation and bcrABCD, UbiX genes for anaerobic aromatic reduction in metagenome-assembled genomes of Bathyarchaeia. Our study demonstrates that niche differentiation between benthic bacteria and archaea may have important consequences in carbon metabolism, particularly for the transformation of recalcitrant organic carbon that may be predominant in aged marine sediments.},

	url = {https://munin.uit.no/handle/10037/22757},
	abstract = {Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. In marine environments, it is buried deep in the sediments in the form of gas hydrate, an ice-like structure. Due to its form, gas hydrate is sensitive to changes in temperature and pressure. Because of that, the ongoing climate change can trigger destabilization of its sub-seabed deposits. This may result in a release of great amounts of methane into the atmosphere. Methane seepage events have occurred in the past and were recorded in the isotopic signature of calcareous tests (shells) of fossil foraminifera. However, not much is known about the possible impact of methane-affected sediments on the living foraminiferal fauna, e.g. in the cold seeps. Due to the hostile conditions within a cold seep, such as low oxygen and elevated carbon dioxide concentration, it remains unclear if benthic foraminifera build their tests during methane emission events and whether, and to what extent, live foraminifera incorporate methane-derived carbon during biomineralization. This knowledge is crucial to establish foraminifera as a reliable tool in tracking methane emissions. The main focus of this thesis was to investigate the response of foraminifera to the combined effect of low oxygen and elevated carbon dioxide concentration in a laboratory setting, replicating conditions that commonly occur in cold seeps. Secondly, this thesis investigates modern foraminiferal assemblages using fluorescence viability assays and a conventional method, Rose Bengal staining. Fluorescence probes react exclusively with metabolically active foraminifera, and so this method distinguishes live foraminifera from the recently dead individuals, creating a more detailed picture of the modern foraminiferal fauna in the study area. Finally, I was able to determine that methane-derived carbon can shift the Œ¥$^{\textrm{13}}$C signature of living (Rose Bengal-stained) foraminifera towards lower Œ¥$^{\textrm{13}}$C values, which is linked to methane-related processes, such as aerobic (MOx) and anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM). Active methane seepage did not markedly affect the isotopic signature (Œ¥$^{\textrm{13}}$C) of primary calcite in metabolically active foraminifera in this study. This work not only advances our understanding of the mechanisms of foraminiferal response to methane seepage events but also facilitates their use in future studies of methane emissions.},

However, ESI FT-ICR MS generally has poor repeatability and reproducibility because of its inherent ionization mechanism and structural characteristics, which severely hindered its application in quantitative analysis of complex mixtures. In this article, we developed an in-house standard method for molecular characterization of DOM by ESI FT-ICR MS. Instead of obtaining reproducible results by determining the instrument parameters, we adopted an approach of object control on the mass spectrum to solve the problem of poor reproducibility. The mass peak shape, resolution, and relative intensity distribution of a natural organic matter standard were adjusted by optimizing the operating conditions to obtain a repeatable result. The quality control sample was run 26 times by the different operators in a 6-month-long period to evaluate the reproducibility. Results showed that the relative standard deviation (\%) of repeatability and reproducibility are 1.02 and 2.35 for average H/C, respectively. The in-house standard method has been validated and successfully used for the characterization of more than 4000 DOM samples, which is transferable to other laboratories.},

Verifying past cold seep activity and biogeochemical characteristics is more challenging but may be reconstructed from proxy records of authigenic seep carbonates. Here, we investigated the lipid-biomarker inventory, carbonate mineralogy, and stable carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of seep-associated carbonates from two active Arctic methane seeps, located to the northwest (Vestnesa Ridge; ‚àº1,200¬†m water depth) and south (Storfjordrenna; ‚àº380¬†m water depth) offshore Svalbard. The aragonite-dominated mineralogy of all but one carbonate sample indicate precipitation close to the seafloor in an environment characterized by high rates of sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). In contrast, Mg-calcite rich nodules sampled in sediments of Storfjordrenna appear to have formed at the sulfate-methane-transition zone deeper within the sediment at lower rates of AOM. AOM activity at the time of carbonate precipitation is indicated by the 13C-depleted isotope signature of the carbonates [‚àí20 to ‚àí30‚Ä∞ Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB)], as well as high concentrations of 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers diagnostic for anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (archaeol and sn2-hydroxyarchaeol) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (iso and anteiso-C15:0 fatty acids) in the carbonates. We also found 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers (diploptene and a 4Œ±-methyl sterol) that are diagnostic for bacteria mediating aerobic oxidation of methane (MOx). This suggests that the spatial separation between AOM and MOx zones was relatively narrow at the time of carbonate formation, as is typical for high methane-flux regimes. The seep-associated carbonates also displayed relatively high Œ¥18O values (4.5‚Äì5‚Ä∞ VPDB), indicating the presence of 18O-enriched fluids during precipitation, possibly derived from destabilized methane gas hydrates. Based on the combined isotopic evidence, we suggest that all the seep carbonates resulted from the anaerobic oxidation of methane during intense methane seepage. The seepage likely was associated to gas hydrates destabilization, which led to the methane ebullition from the seafloor into the water column.},

	abstract = {For almost three decades, flow cytometry has allowed researchers to investigate ocean planktonic communities using size and cell fluorescence properties. However, oceanographic applications must face two constraints. First, when dealing with marine microbes, instruments must be sensitive because these organisms are very small and with low fluorescence. Second, instruments must be portable to be used on board ships. We compared the performance of two instruments, the BD FACSCanto‚Ñ¢ and BD Accuri‚Ñ¢ C6. The former is an expensive laboratory-based instrument which has a very good sensitivity, whilst the latter is less sensitive but presents critical advantages for field studies (easy handling and transportation, relatively low cost). We have analyzed 102 samples from the South Atlantic Ocean from three transects off Brazil, within the euphotic zone. We compared cell abundance of heterotrophic bacteria, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, as well as photosynthetic pico- and nano-eukaryotes. Heterotrophic bacteria, pico- and nano-eukaryotes could be easily detected with both cytometers. Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus populations were severely under-estimated with the BD Accuri‚Ñ¢ C6, particularly for samples from the well-lit layers of the water column. Correction of abundance data using previously suggested approaches was not sufficient to fully compensate for the low sensibility. Our data suggest that the BD Accuri‚Ñ¢ C6 is suitable for counting marine bacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes, but not Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus.},

Below 7 ¬∞C, syntrophic propionate oxidation was the rate-limiting step for CH
              4
              production; above this threshold temperature, polysaccharide hydrolysis became rate limiting. This change was associated with a shift within the functional guild for syntrophic propionate oxidation, with Firmicutes being replaced by Bacteroidetes. Correspondingly, there was a shift from the formate- and H

	abstract = {Abstract. Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas. Its atmospheric mixing
ratios have been increasing since 2005. Therefore, quantification of
CH4 sources is essential for effective climate change mitigation.
Here we report observations of the CH4 mixing ratios measured at the
Zeppelin Observatory (Svalbard) in the Arctic and aboard the research
vessel¬†(RV) Helmer Hanssen over the Arctic Ocean from June 2014 to
December 2016, as well as the long-term CH4 trend measured at the
Zeppelin Observatory from 2001 to 2017. We investigated areas over the
European Arctic Ocean to identify possible hotspot regions emitting
CH4 from the ocean to the atmosphere, and used state-of-the-art
modelling¬†(FLEXPART) combined with updated emission inventories to identify
CH4 sources. Furthermore, we collected air samples in the region as
well as samples of gas hydrates, obtained from the sea floor, which we
analysed using a new technique whereby hydrate gases are sampled directly
into evacuated canisters. Using this new methodology, we evaluated the
suitability of ethane and isotopic signatures (Œ¥13C in
CH4) as tracers for ocean-to-atmosphere CH4 emission. We
found that the average methane‚Äâ/‚Äâlight hydrocarbon (ethane and propane)
ratio is an order of magnitude higher for the same sediment samples using our
new methodology compared to previously reported values, 2379.95 vs. 460.06,
respectively. Meanwhile, we show that the mean atmospheric CH4 mixing
ratio in the Arctic increased by 5.9¬±0.38 parts per billion by
volume¬†(ppb) per year (yr‚àí1) from 2001 to 2017 and ‚àº8‚Äâpbb‚Äâyr‚àí1 since 2008, similar to the global trend of
‚àº‚Äâ7‚Äì8‚Äâppb‚Äâyr‚àí1. Most large excursions from the baseline
CH4 mixing ratio over the European Arctic Ocean are due to long-range
transport from land-based sources, lending confidence to the present
inventories for high-latitude CH4 emissions. However, we also
identify a potential hotspot region with ocean‚Äìatmosphere CH4 flux
north of Svalbard (80.4‚àò‚ÄâN, 12.8‚àò‚ÄâE) of up to
26‚Äânmol‚Äâm‚àí2‚Äâs‚àí1 from a large mixing ratio increase at the
location of 30‚Äâppb. Since this flux is consistent with previous constraints
(both spatially and temporally), there is no evidence that the area of
interest north of Svalbard is unique in the context of the wider Arctic.
Rather, because the meteorology at the time of the observation was unique in
the context of the measurement time series, we obtained over the short course
of the episode measurements highly sensitive to emissions over an active seep
site, without sensitivity to land-based emissions.},

	abstract = {Methane (CH4) emitted into the coastal ocean faces two primary fates: escape to the atmosphere or prolonged dissolution that allows sufficient time for oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria. The partitioning of CH4 between these fates is modulated by physical, chemical and biological factors, including the distribution of CH4 in the water, temperature, wind speed, water movement, and the biological CH4 oxidation rate. Because of the underlying complexity, studies rarely quantify all of these factors in unison, thereby leaving gaps in our understanding of CH4 biogeochemistry in the coastal ocean. In this study we estimated the partitioning of CH4 between transport, microbial oxidative loss, and sea‚Äìair transfer in a defined plume of dissolved CH4 originating from one of the world's largest seep fields, near Coal Oil Point (COP) in the Santa Barbara Channel, California. Depth distributions of CH4 concentration, biologically mediated oxidation rate, and current velocity were quantified at 12 stations in a 198km2 area down-current from COP on July 4‚Äì5, 2007. Six stations were sampled again on July 7, 2007 to evaluate temporal plume variability. The observed CH4 distribution revealed two distinct CH4 plumes: a shallow plume centered at ‚àº40m and a deeper plume centered at ‚àº200m. The shallow plume originates at COP; the source of the deeper CH4 plume is not known. Cross-sections of both plumes were used to calculate transport and loss terms for dissolved CH4. The results indicate that the majority of the dissolved CH4 is advected and diffuses horizontally by turbulence whereas microbial oxidation, sea‚Äìair gas transfer, and vertical turbulent diffusion are less significant. Based on rates estimated in the study area, a model was developed to simulate the fate of the dissolved CH4. The model results suggest that 60\% of the CH4 of the sampled plumes will ultimately be microbially oxidized and 40\% will be transferred to the atmosphere by sea‚Äìair gas exchange under the sampling conditions. These results illustrate the significance of microbial CH4 oxidation in coastal oceans.},

Characteristic succession patterns were observed for two phylogenetic groups of bacteria that both transiently formed {\textgreater} 50\% of total cells. An initial bloom of bacteria affiliated to the Alteromonadaceae could not be assigned to any specific treatment and was interpreted as a response to the manipulations during mesocosm set-up. These bacteria rapidly declined with the appearance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, suggesting a negative effect of selective grazing. The persistence of Alteromonadaceae in the microbial assemblages was significantly favored by the presence of additional glucose. During the second half of the experiment, bacteria affiliated to Rhodobacteriaceae formed a dominant component of the experimental assemblages in treatments with addition of P. The community contribution of Rhodobacteriaceae was significantly correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations only in the P-amended mesocosms (r2 = 0.58). This was more pronounced in the absence of glucose (r2 = 0.85). The phylogenetic and morphological diversity among Rhodobacteriaceae was high, and treatment-specific temporal successions of genotypes related to Rhodobacteriaceae were observed. We suggest that the observed succession patterns reflect different niche preferences: Alteromonadaceae rapidly responded to disturbance and profited from allochthonous glucose input, whereas Rhodobacteriaceae benefited from the phytoplankton bloom.},

The bulk uptake of the compounds increased in the upwelling, with amino acids being the most actively taken up substrate (up to 20 pmol L‚àí1 h‚àí1). The single-cell activity of the bacterial groups also increased in the upwelling, particularly for Rhodobacteraceae (up to 94\% of active cells), but this group had low activity in oligotrophic waters ({\textless} 10\% of active cells), which suggests it is exclusively adapted to high-nutrient conditions. The percentage of SAR11 active cells was relatively high in the upwelling area, particularly for glucose and amino acid uptake (up to 53\% of active cells), which suggests that some members of this group are also adapted to nutrient-rich environments. Of the broad phylogenetic groups tested, Bacteroidetes were the least active and Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria showed similar percentages of active cells in amino acid uptake (‚àº 30\%). Alphaproteobacteria had the highest percent of cells involved in glucose uptake, while Gammaproteobacteria dominated ATP uptake. This general pattern was confirmed in a broader analysis that included data from contrasting marine environments, which suggests that major phylogenetic groups of bacteria participate differently in the turnover of these low-molecular-weight organics. Our results support the view that broad phylogenetic groups can be identified within the bacterial ‚Äòblack box‚Äô with different patterns in the cycling of organic matter.

The addition of yeast extract, a complex substrate rich in N and growth factors, promoted the proliferation of Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Grazing pressure exerted by nanoflagellates produced marked differences on the size structure of the prokaryotic biomass. A pronounced tendency to filamentation and aggregation was observed in the glucose treatment, while in the case of yeast extract, small and mainly freely dispersed prokaryotes were maintained throughout the incubations. Thus, the final community in the yeast extract treatment showed a high percentage of edible biomass, while an important fraction of potentially grazing-resistant prokaryotes (more than 50\% of total prokaryotic biomass) was detected in the microcosms enriched with glucose.

	abstract = {To test whether protist grazing selectively affects the composition of aquatic bacterial communities, we combined high-throughput sequencing to determine bacterial community composition with analyses of grazing rates, protist and bacterial abundances and bacterial cell sizes and physiological states in a mesocosm experiment in which nutrients were added to stimulate a phytoplankton bloom. A large variability was observed in the abundances of bacteria (from 0.7 to 2.4 √ó 106 cells per ml), heterotrophic nanoflagellates (from 0.063 to 2.7 √ó 104 cells per ml) and ciliates (from 100 to 3000 cells per l) during the experiment (‚àº3-, 45- and 30-fold, respectively), as well as in bulk grazing rates (from 1 to 13 √ó 106 bacteria per ml per day) and bacterial production (from 3 to 379‚ÄâŒºg per C‚Äâl per day) (1 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively). However, these strong changes in predation pressure did not induce comparable responses in bacterial community composition, indicating that bacterial community structure was resilient to changes in protist predation pressure. Overall, our results indicate that peaks in protist predation (at least those associated with phytoplankton blooms) do not necessarily trigger substantial changes in the composition of coastal marine bacterioplankton communities.},

	abstract = {We explored how marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) altered by bacterial growth and protozoan grazing modify the metabolism of Southeastern Cantabrian Sea (CS) and NW Mediterranean Sea (MS) coastal bacterial communities. Major metabolic features were measured in treatments with half of the natural water replaced by water with different DOM quality, characterized by fluorescent DOM analysis and collected from key times of the predator‚Äìprey curve. In both ecosystems, protozoan-altered DOM led to similar increases in bacterial carbon demand (238\% and 213\%) and decreases in bacterial growth efficiency (BGE: 56\% for the CS and 46\% for the MS). These low BGEs were caused by similar bacterial production but much higher bacterial respiration rates, which in turn were positively related to aminopeptidase activity. However, in the CS bacterial community dominated by Bacteroidetes (41\%), the enhanced hydrolytic activity was produced at a lower metabolic cost than in the MS, dominated by SAR11 (47\%), which suggests a better adaptation of Bacteroidetes to the DOM altered during protozoan grazing. These results highlight protozoan grazing as a relevant factor influencing BGE in coastal ecosystems, and relate bacterial community composition to the major metabolic processes that result after a change in the quality of marine DOM.},

and colloidal metal-organic species. Metal/carbon ratios of the particle pool in some model systems with grazers were significantly altered, indicating a decoupling of trace metal and organic carbon cycling through the grazing process. Different protist
species exhibited substantial variation (up to a factor of 10) in their ability to quantitatively remobilize trace metals from bacterial prey. The implications of these findings for trace metal cycling in marine systems are discussed.},

	abstract = {Production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by marine phytoplankton supplies the majority of organic substrate consumed by heterotrophic bacterioplankton in the sea. This production and subsequent consumption converts a vast quantity of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus between organic and inorganic forms, directly impacting global cycles of these biologically important elements. Details regarding the chemical composition of DOM produced by marine phytoplankton are sparse, and while often assumed, it is not currently known if phylogenetically distinct groups of marine phytoplankton release characteristic suites of DOM. To investigate the relationship between specific phytoplankton groups and the DOM they release, hydrophobic phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic matter (DOMP) from eight axenic strains was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Identification of DOM features derived from Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Thalassiosira, and Phaeodactylum revealed DOMP to be complex and highly strain dependent. Connections between DOMP features and the phylogenetic relatedness of these strains were identified on multiple levels of phylogenetic distance, suggesting that marine phytoplankton produce DOM that in part reflects its phylogenetic origin. Chemical information regarding the size and polarity ranges of features from defined biological sources was also obtained. Our findings reveal DOMP composition to be partially conserved among related phytoplankton species, and implicate marine DOM as a potential factor influencing microbial diversity in the sea by acting as a link between autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial community structures.},

	abstract = {Subsurface microbial oxidation of overridden soils and vegetation beneath glaciers and ice sheets may aÔ¨Äect global carbon budgets on glacial‚Äìinterglacial timescales. The likelihood and magnitude of this process depends on the chemical nature and reactivity of the subglacial organic carbon stores. We examined the composition of carbon pools associated with diÔ¨Äerent regions of the Greenland ice sheet (subglacial, supraglacial, proglacial) in order to elucidate the type of dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in the subglacial discharge over a melt season. Electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry coupled to multivariate statistics permitted unprecedented molecular level characterization of this material and revealed that carbon pools associated with discrete glacial regions are comprised of different compound classes. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, a larger proportion of protein-like compounds were observed in the supraglacial samples and in the early melt season (spring) subglacial discharge. In contrast, the late melt season (summer) subglacial discharge contained a greater fraction of lignin-like and other material presumably derived from underlying vegetation and soil. These results suggest (1) that the majority of supraglacial DOM originates from autochthonous microbial processes on the ice sheet surface, (2) that the subglacial DOM contains allochthonous carbon derived from overridden soils and vegetation as well as autochthonous carbon derived from in situ microbial metabolism, and (3) that the relative contribution of allochthonous and autochthonous material in subglacial discharge varies during the melt season. These conclusions are consistent with the hypothesis that, given suÔ¨Écient time (e.g., overwinter storage), resident subglacial microbial communities may oxidize terrestrial material beneath the Greenland ice sheet.},

	abstract = {The effects of grazing pressure and inorganic nutrient availability on the direct carbon transfer from freshly produced phytoplankton exudates to heterotrophic bacteria biomass production were studied in Mediterranean coastal waters. The short-term incorporation of 13C (H13CO3) in phytoplankton and bacterial lipid biomarkers was measured as well as the total bacterial carbon production (BP), viral lysis and the microbial community structure under three experimental conditions: (1) High inorganic Nutrient and High Grazing (HN + HG), (2) High inorganic Nutrient and Low Grazing (HN + LG) and (3) under natural in situ conditions with Low inorganic Nutrient and High Grazing (LN + HG) during spring. Under phytoplankton bloom conditions (HN + LG), the bacterial use of freshly produced phytoplankton exudates as a source of carbon, estimated from 13C enrichment of bacterial lipids, contributed more than half of the total bacterial production. However, under conditions of high grazing pressure on phytoplankton with or without the addition of inorganic nutrients (HN + HG and LN + HG), the 13C enrichment of bacterial lipids was low compared with the high total bacterial production. BP therefore seems to depend mainly on freshly produced phytoplankton exudates during the early phase of phytoplankton bloom period. However, BP seems mainly relying on recycled carbon from viral lysis and predators under high grazing pressure.},

	abstract = {Heterotrophic bacterial growth and the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) produced by bacteria from freshwater and marine environments were monitored during experiments with artificial media containing glucose as the sole carbon source. Glucose was quickly consumed, and DOM was released during bacterial growth. Percentages of extracellular release of DOM from bacteria ranged from 14\% to 31\%, indicating that bacterial production and growth efficiency are underestimated when only cellular carbon is measured. Relatively high concentrations of D-alanine (D-Ala) were observed in DOM released during exponential growth, whereas the concentrations of muramic acid and other D-amino acid components of peptidoglycan were not detected or were in low concentration. The selective release of D-Ala occurred during cell growth and division when peptidoglycan is cleaved and newly synthesized subunits are incorporated into the cell wall via transpeptidation. Most of the D-Ala released during exponential growth was rapidly consumed. Following exponential growth, bacterial abundance decreased due to grazing and possibly viral lysis. The DOM remaining in the incubations after one or more months included a mixture of D-amino acids commonly found in peptidoglycan and the amino sugars glucosamine and galactosamine, which were highly resistant to decomposition. The percentage of D-amino acids was much higher in DOM than in cells due to the preferential release of D-amino acids and decomposition of L-amino acids. The final concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from 20 to 30 ¬µmol L-1 regardless of the initial concentration of glucose or the source of inoculum. The observed abundances of D-amino acids and amino sugars in DOM from diverse aquatic environments indicate a bacterial source and common decomposition processes.},

Both phytoplankton and bacterioplankton assimilate and release DFAA, but their consumption and production are difficult to quantify in nature due to their short residence times (min) as dissolved monomers. We segregated DFAA production by phytoplankton and bacterial consumption by measuring individual DFAA concentrations in four axenic phytoplankton cultures during the exponential growth phase, and also after 4 d incubations in the presence of a natural bacterioplankton community. The amounts and composition of the DFAA pool varied widely among phytoplankton species. The proportion of dissolved organic carbon attributed to DFAA varied among cultures. The picoeukaryotic prasinophyte, Micromonas pusilla, released higher amounts of DFAA than the other species tested (diatoms and dinoflagellate), especially alanine, which has been reported as the dominant individual DFAA in some oligotrophic environments. Community structure of heterotrophic prokaryotes responded to differences in the quality of organic matter released among microalgal species, with Roseobacter-related bacteria responding strongly to exudate composition. Our results demonstrate the specificity of DFAA extracellular release among several algal species and their preferential uptake by members of bacterial communities.},

investigated direct release from plankton as a factor contributing to distribution patterns of CDOM. We measured the production of CDOM by zooplankton (copepods, euphausiids, amphipods, salps, polychaetes), protozoans (colonial radiolaria), and by the
colonial cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. Groups of individual species of plankton were incubated and absorption spectra were obtained for their release products. CDOM was produced by all organisms examined,
and absorption spectra varied by taxa, with major taxa exhibiting characteristic absorption peaks. Plankton-produced DOM is a source of labile carbon facilitating microbial activity, and CDOM may also serve as photoprotection for near-surface-living
organisms. Zooplankton likely play an important role in the CDOM cycle in the Sargasso Sea, directly through release/excretion of CDOM and indirectly by providing a labile substrate (excretia) for microbial-mediated production of CDOM.},

Unlabeled bacterioplankton assemblages were incubated 24 h with either fractionated or unfractionated DO14Cwhich was released during grazing experiments. Bacterioplankton utilized 196 \% d-I + 100 more of the DO14Creleased in presence of cultured ciliates or microzooplankton than D014Creleased in their absence. Low ({\textless}5 X 102daltons) and intermediate NMW (103to 104daltons) labeled fractions were incorporated and respired more rapidly by bacteria than the other 3 NMW labeled fractions. Fractionation of D014C after bacterial incubation revealed a decrease in all NMW classes and a shift toward a dominance of low NMW labeled fractions in the D0I4C released in the presence of grazers, but not in the controls. Bactivorous ciliates and microzooplankton contribute quantitatively and qualitatively to the dissolved organic matter pool in nearshore planktonic systems.

This paradox has been noted repeatedly in the microbiology literature but lacks a generally accepted mechanistic explanation. To explain this paradox quantitatively, we develop a bacteria-grazer model of organic matter decomposition that incorporates protozoa-driven nutrient recycling and stoichiometry. Unlike previous efforts, the current model includes explicit limitation, via Liebig's law of minimum, by two possible factors, nutrient and carbon densities, as well as their relative ratios in bacteria and grazers. Our model shows two principal results: (1) when the environment is carbon limiting, organic matter can always be decomposed completely, regardless of the presence/absence of grazers; (2) when the environment is nutrient (such as nitrogen) limiting, it is possible for organic matter to be completely decomposed in the presence, but not absence, of grazers. Grazers facilitate decomposition by releasing nutrients back into the environment, which would otherwise be limiting, while preying upon bacteria. Model analysis reveals that facilitation of organic matter decomposition by grazers is positively related to the stoichiometric difference between bacteria and grazers. In addition, we predict the existence of an optimal density range of introduced grazers, which maximally facilitate the decomposition of organic matter in a fixed time period. This optimal range reflects a trade-off between grazer-induced nutrient recycling and grazer-induced mortality of bacteria.},

Exuded compounds fuel the microbial food web and often encompass bioactive secondary metabolites like sex pheromones, allelochemicals, antibiotics, or feeding attractants that mediate biological interactions. Despite this importance, little is known about the bioactive compounds present in phytoplankton exudates. We report a stable-isotope metabolic footprinting method to characterise exudates from aquatic autotrophs. Exudates from 13C-enriched alga were concentrated by solid phase extraction and analysed by high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. We used the harmful algal bloom forming dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense to prove the method. An algorithm was developed to automatically pinpoint just those metabolites with highly 13C-enriched isotope signatures, allowing us to discover algal exudates from the complex seawater background. The stable-isotope pattern (SIP) of the detected metabolites then allowed for more accurate assignment to an empirical formula, a critical first step in their identification. This automated workflow provides an effective way to explore the chemical nature of the solutes exuded from phytoplankton cells and will facilitate the discovery of novel dissolved  bioactive compounds.},

Bacterial groups contributed to EPS and glucose assimilation in part according to their distribution in the estuary. Abundance of the phylogenetic groups explained 35\% and 55\% of the variation in EPS and glucose assimilation, respectively. Actinobacteria contributed 70\% to glucose assimilation in freshwater, while Alphaproteobacteria assimilated 60\% of this compound in saline water. In contrast, various bacterial groups dominated the assimilation of EPS. Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria contributed the most in the freshwater section, whereas Cytophaga-like bacteria and Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria participated in EPS assimilation in the lower part of the estuary. In addition, we examined the fraction of bacteria in each group that assimilated glucose or EPS. Overall, the fraction of bacteria in all groups that assimilated glucose was higher than the fraction that assimilated EPS (15 to 30\% versus 5 to 20\%, respectively). We found no correlation between the relative abundance of a group in the estuary and the fraction of bacteria actively assimilating glucose or EPS; the more active groups were often less abundant. Our results imply that the bacterial community in the Delaware Estuary is not controlled solely by ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù factors such as dissolved organic matter.},

	abstract = {Dissolved methane concentrations in the ocean are close to equilibrium with the atmosphere. Because methane is only sparingly soluble in seawater, measuring it without contamination is challenging for samples collected and processed in the presence of air. Several methods for analyzing dissolved methane are described in the literature, yet none has conducted a thorough assessment of the method yield, contamination issues during collection, transport and storage, and the effect of temperature changes and preservative. Previous extraction methods transfer methane from water to gas by either a 'sparge and trap' or a 'headspace equilibration' technique. The gas is then analyzed for methane by gas chromatography. Here, we revisit the headspace equilibration technique and describe a simple, inexpensive, and reliable method to measure methane in fresh and seawater, regardless of concentration. Within the range of concentrations typically found in surface seawaters (2-1000 nmol L-1), the yield of the method nears 100\% of what is expected from solubility calculation following the addition of known amount of methane. In addition to being sensitive (detection limit of 0.1 ppmv, or 0.74 nmol L-1), this method requires less than 10 min per sample, and does not use highly toxic chemicals. It can be conducted with minimum materials and does not require the use of a gas chromatograph at the collection site. It can therefore be used in various remote working environments and conditions.},

We investigate microbial communities in gas hydrate-bearing seafloor mounds at Storfjordrenna, offshore Svalbard in the high Arctic, where we identify distinct methane concentration profiles that include steady-state, recently-increasing subsurface diffusive flux, and active gas seepage. Populations of anaerobic methanotrophs and sulfate-reducing bacteria were highest at the seep site, while decreased community diversity was associated with a recent increase in methane influx. Despite high methane fluxes and methanotroph doubling times estimated at 5‚Äì9 months, microbial community responses were largely synchronous with the advancement of methane into shallower sediment horizons. Together, these provide a framework for interpreting subseafloor microbial responses to methane escape in a warming Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {The partitioning of organic matter (OM) between dissolved and particulate phases is an important factor in determining the fate of organic carbon in the ocean. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) release by phytoplankton is a ubiquitous process, resulting in 2‚Äì50\% of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis leaving the cell. This loss can be divided into two components: passive leakage by diffusion across the cell membrane and the active exudation of DOM into the surrounding environment. At present there is no method to distinguish whether DOM is released via leakage or exudation. Most explanations for exudation remain hypothetical; as while DOM release has been measured extensively, there has been relatively little work to determine why DOM is released. Further research is needed to determine the composition of the DOM released by phytoplankton and to link composition to phytoplankton physiological status and environmental conditions. For example, the causes and physiology of phytoplankton cell death are poorly understood, though cell death increases membrane permeability and presumably DOM release. Recent work has shown that phytoplankton interactions with bacteria are important in determining both the amount and composition of the DOM released. In response to increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, climate change is creating increasingly stressful conditions for phytoplankton in the surface ocean, including relatively warm water, low pH, low nutrient supply and high light. As ocean physics and chemistry change, it is hypothesized that a greater proportion of primary production will be released directly by phytoplankton into the water as DOM. Changes in the partitioning of primary production between the dissolved and particulate phases will have bottom-up effects on ecosystem structure and function. There is a need for research to determine how these changes affect the fate of organic matter in the ocean, particularly the efficiency of the biological carbon pump.},

Here, a method is developed for correcting strict signal-to-noise thresholds, along with a new scheme for assessing the reproducibility of peak magnitudes. Furthermore, a systematic approach for discerning when the comparison of samples by the presence or absence of peaks is appropriate and when it is necessary to compare based on the relative magnitude of the peaks is presented. A variety of 10 different types of NOM samples are analyzed in duplicate or triplicate instrumental injections or experimental extractions.

The upward trend in HRMS analysis of DOM presents challenges in data comparison and interpretation among laboratories operating instruments with differing performance and user operating conditions. It is therefore essential that the community establishes metric ranges and compositional trends for data comparison with reference samples so that data can be robustly compared among research groups. To this end, four identically prepared DOM samples were each measured by 16 laboratories, using 17 commercially purchased instruments, using positive-ion and negative-ion mode electrospray ionization (ESI) HRMS analyses. The instruments identified 1000 common ions in both negative- and positive-ion modes over a wide range of m/z values and chemical space, as determined by van Krevelen diagrams. Calculated metrics of abundance-weighted average indices (H/C, O/C, aromaticity, and m/z) of the commonly detected ions showed that hydrogen saturation and aromaticity were consistent for each reference sample across the instruments, while average mass and oxygenation were more affected by differences in instrument type and settings. In this paper we present 32 metric values for future benchmarking. The metric values were obtained for the four different parameters from four samples in two ionization modes and can be used in future work to evaluate the performance of HRMS instruments.},

M. aeruginosa produced thousands of detectable compounds in axenic culture. These compounds were chromatographically resolved and the majority were assigned to aliphatic formulas with a broad polarity range.

The DOM degradation kinetics modeled using reactivity continuum models showed that composition was more important than environment in determining the bulk DOM decay patterns. Changes in DOM composition resulted from the interaction between DOM source and environment. The role of environment was stronger on shaping the bacterial community composition, but the intrinsic nature of the DOM source exerted stronger control on the DOM degradation function.},

Addition of 13C-bicarbonate showed a strong coupling between algal primary production and bacterial secondary production, while addition of 13C-glucose revealed bacteria as a carbon source for eukaryotes. Tracing the 13C into mesozooplankton, we identified selective grazing on algae during the phytoplankton bloom, transfer of carbon from bacteria to mesozooplankton and opportunistic feeding strategies after the bloom. Nitrogen labeling confirmed carbon labeling findings, identified bacteria rather than mesozooplankton as ammonium regenerators and allowed quantification of nitrification.},

Conversely, proteobacterial copiotrophs, which were rare in the ambient water ({\textless} 0.1\% of sequences), grew rapidly on all DOC amendments at both depths, but with different substrate preferences among lineages.

Some clear-cut evidence for geographic isolation has been obtained by genetic methods but, in many cases, the markers used are too coarse to reveal subtle biogeographical trends. Contrary to eukaryotic microorganisms, phenotypic evidence for allopatric segregation in prokaryotes has never been found. Here we present, for the first time, a metabolomic approach based on ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to reveal phenotypic biogeographical discrimination. We demonstrate that strains of the cosmopolitan extremophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber, isolated from different sites in the world, can be distinguished by means of characteristic metabolites, and that these differences can be correlated to their geographical isolation site distances. The approach allows distinct degrees of discrimination for isolates at different geographical scales. In all cases, the discriminative metabolite patterns were quantitative rather than qualitative, which may be an indication of geographically distinct transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulations.},

	url = {https://munin.uit.no/handle/10037/22978},
	abstract = {Cold seeps are locations on the seafloor where CH$_{\textrm{4}}$ migrates from reservoirs below sediments towards the atmosphere, sustaining thereby a high microbial and macrofaunal biomass and a diversity contrasting from the surrounding seafloor. The oxidation of methane and sulphide are typically the main sources of primary productivity of these ecosystems and have therefore gained a particular attention in the global oceans. Yet, despite the ubiquitous presence of these seeping sites and the presence of gas hydrates in the Arctic Ocean and its adjacent shelves, the impact of methane on benthic and pelagic microbial communities in this region have remained limited. Recently, five gas hydrate bearing mounds with ongoing methane seeping activity were discovered south of Svalbard, in the northern Barents Sea. In this PhD project, I studied changes in the structure of microbial communities, including both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and geochemical profiles at these mounds to highlight key microbial groups and to provide insights on their ecological roles. Different niches were addressed, including: deep anaerobic sediments (Paper I and II); niches at the sediment surface at gas flare locations and within bacterial mats and siboglinid fields (Paper III); and above gas flares in the shallow shelf water column (Paper IV). The microbial biodiversity and the structure of communities were successfully identified for each of the habitats listed above. Our investigations revealed a microbial composition similar to other cold seeps: a predominance of archaeal anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME) and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in CH$_{\textrm{4}}$-rich sediments, a higher abundance of methane oxidizing bacteria associated to the Methylococcales in the surface sediments and water column; and a co-occurrence of other commonly found prokaryotic groups. Yet, uncommon biological traits were also uncovered at these methane seeping sites: the anaerobic oxidation of methane was merely only driven by ANME-1 without the co-occurrence of a specific SRB clade; an abundant methanotroph with little genetic similarity in databases was detected; and a strong niche differentiation of sulphide-oxidizing bacteria within the different bacterial mats. This project has thereby extended our knowledge on the microbial biodiversity at Arctic cold seeps and opened further future research perspective toward microbial activity and metabolism at these high latitudes.},

Cells of strains H2(T) and Sakb1 were aerobic, Gram-negative, non-motile, straight or curved rods that were covered by large polysaccharide capsules and contained an intracytoplasmic membrane system typical of type II methanotrophs. They possessed both a particulate and a soluble methane monooxygenase and utilized the serine pathway for carbon assimilation. They were moderately acidophilic organisms capable of growth between pH 4.4 and 7.5 (optimum 5.8-6.2). The most unique characteristic of these strains was the phospholipid fatty acid profile. In addition to the signature fatty acid of type II methanotrophs (18 : 1omega8c), the cells also contained large amounts of what was previously considered to be a signature fatty acid of type I methanotrophs, 16 : 1omega8c. The DNA G+C contents of strains H2(T) and Sakb1 were 61.5 and 62.1 mol\%, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene sequences possessed 96-98 \% similarity to sequences of other type II methanotrophs in the genera Methylosinus and Methylocystis. 16S rRNA gene sequence and pmoA phylogeny demonstrated that the strains form a novel lineage within the genus Methylocystis. DNA-DNA hybridization values of strain H2(T) with Methylocystis parvus OBBP(T) and Methylocystis echinoides IMET 10491(T) were 18 and 25 \%, respectively. Thus, it is proposed that these two strains represent a novel species, Methylocystis heyeri sp. nov. Strain H2(T) (=DSM 16984(T)=VKM B-2426(T)) is the type strain.},

Here we demonstrate that members of the recently discovered genus Methylocella are an exception to this. These bacteria are able to use as their sole energy source the one-carbon compounds methane and methanol, as well as the multicarbon compounds acetate, pyruvate, succinate, malate, and ethanol. To conclusively verify facultative growth, acetate and methane were used as model substrates in growth experiments with the type strain Methylocella silvestris BL2. Quantitative real-time PCR targeting the mmoX gene, which encodes a subunit of soluble methane monooxygenase, showed that copies of this gene increased in parallel with cell counts during growth on either acetate or methane as the sole substrate. This verified that cells possessing the genetic basis of methane oxidation grew on acetate as well as methane. Cloning of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescence in situ hybridization with strain-specific and genus-specific oligonucleotide probes detected no contaminants in cultures. The growth rate and carbon conversion efficiency were higher on acetate than on methane, and when both substrates were provided in excess, acetate was preferably used and methane oxidation was shut down. Our data demonstrate that not all methanotrophic bacteria are limited to growing on one-carbon compounds. This could have major implications for understanding the factors controlling methane fluxes in the environment.},

	abstract = {Here we present a high-resolution, continuous seismostratigraphic framework that for the first time, connects the over 1,000 km long western Svalbard-Barents Sea margin and covers the last ‚àº2.7 million years (Ma). By exploiting recent improvements in chronology, we establish a set of reliable age fix-points from available boreholes along the margin. We then use a large 2-D seismic database to extend this consistent chronology from the Yermak Plateau and offshore western Svalbard, southwards to the Bear Island Trough-Mouth Fan. Based on this new stratigraphic framework we divide the seismic stratigraphy along the continental margin into three seismic units, and 12 regionally correlated seismic reflections, each with an estimated age assignment. We demonstrate one potential application of this framework by reconstructing the Svalbard-Barents Sea Ice Sheet evolution from the intensification of the northern hemisphere glaciation at ‚àº2.7 Ma to the Weichselian glaciations. Through seismic facies distribution and sedimentation rate fluctuations along the margin we distinguish three phases of glacial development. The higher temporal resolution provided by this new framework, allows us to document a clear two-step onset to glacial intensification in the region during phase 1, between ‚àº2.7 and 1.5 Ma. The initial step, between ‚àº2.7 and 2.58 Ma shows glacial expansion across Svalbard. The first indication of shelf-edge glaciation is on the Sjubrebanken Trough-Mouth Fan, northwestern Barents Sea after ‚àº2.58 Ma; whilst the second step, between ‚àº1.95 and 1.78 Ma shows glacial advances beyond Svalbard to the northwestern Barents Sea. Phase 2 is characterized by variations in sedimentation rates and the seismic facies are indicative for a regional glacial intensification for the whole Barents Sea-Svalbard region with widespread shelf-edge glaciations recorded at around ‚àº1.5 Ma. During Phase 3, the western Barents Sea margin is characterized by a dramatic increase in sedimentation rates, inferring once again a regional glacial intensification. Our new stratigraphic framework allows for the first time differentiation of the sediments deposited on the slope during Early Saalian (‚àº0.4 and 0.2 Ma), Late Saalian (‚àº0.2 and 0.13 Ma), and Weichselian ({\textless}‚àº0.123 Ma) periods, providing new insights into the Barents Sea glaciations over the last ‚àº0.42 Ma.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Yermak Plateau (YP), located northwest of Svalbard in Fram Strait, is the final passage for the inflow of warm Atlantic Water into the Arctic Ocean. The region is characterized by the largest barotropic tidal velocities in the Arctic Ocean. Internal response to the tidal flow over this topographic feature locally contributes to mixing that removes heat from the Atlantic Water. Here, we investigate the tidal forcing, barotropic-to-baroclinic energy conversion rates, and dissipation rates in the region using observations of oceanic currents, hydrography, and microstructure collected on the southern flanks of the plateau in summer 2007, together with results from a global high-resolution ocean circulation and tide model simulation. The energetics (depth-integrated conversion rates, baroclinic energy fluxes and dissipation rates) show large spatial variability over the plateau and are dominated by the luni-solar diurnal (K1) and the principal lunar semidiurnal (M2) constituents. The volume-integrated conversion rate over the region enclosing the topographic feature is approximately 1 GW and accounts for about 50\% of the M2 and approximately all of the K1 conversion in a larger domain covering the entire Fram Strait extended to the North Pole. Despite the substantial energy conversion, internal tides are trapped along the topography, implying large local dissipation rates. An approximate local conversion‚Äìdissipation balance is found over shallows and also in the deep part of the sloping flanks. The baroclinic energy radiated away from the upper slope is dissipated over the deeper isobaths. From the microstructure observations, we inferred lower and upper bounds on the total dissipation rate of about 0.5 and 1.1 GW, respectively, where about 0.4‚Äì0.6 GW can be attributed to the contribution of hot spots of energetic turbulence. The domain-integrated dissipation from the model is close to the upper bound of the observed dissipation, and implies that almost the entire dissipation in the region can be attributed to the dissipation of baroclinic tidal energy.},

We analysed hydroacoustic and 2D high-resolution seismic data from the apparently intact continental slope immediately north of the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide for signs of past and future instabilities. Our new bathymetry and seismic data show clear evidence for incipient slope instability. Minor slide deposits and an internally-deformed sedimentary layer near the base of the gas hydrate stability zone imply an incomplete failure event, most probably about 30000 years ago, contemporaneous to or shortly after the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide. An active gas reservoir at the base of the gas hydrate stability zone demonstrate that over-pressured fluids might have played a key role in the initiation of slope failure at the studied slope, but more importantly also for the giant HYM slope failure. To date, it is not clear, if the studied slope is fully preconditioned to fail completely in future or if it might be slowly deforming and creeping at present. We detected widespread methane seepage on the adjacent shallow shelf areas not sealed by gas hydrates.},

	abstract = {Even though aerobic methane-oxidation coupled to denitrification (AME-D) has been extensively studied, the exact estimation of CH4 utilization during this process still requires better understanding because effective utilization of CH4 is essential in denitrification performance, CH4 emission and economy. This study presents the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on CH4 utilization in an AME-D bioreactor. Stoichiometries for AME-D were newly established by using the energy balance and the thermodynamic electron equivalent model. The theoretically determined CH4 utilized/NO3‚àí consumed (C/N) ratio from the stoichiometry was 2.0. However, the C/N ratios obtained from the experiment varied with increasing tendency as the HRT increased. Specifically, the C/N ratio increased from 1.38 to 2.85 when the HRT increased from 0.5 to 1.0 days, which placed the theoretical C/N ratio at the HRT between 0.5 and 1.0 days. The higher C/N ratio at the longer HRT was associated with a larger CH4 utilization by methanotrophs than denitrifiers. The results obtained in this study together with those obtained in previous studies clearly illustrated that a variety of conditions affect the utilization of CH4 which is essential for optimizing the AME-D process.},

	abstract = {In pristine sea ice-covered Arctic waters the potential of natural attenuation of oil spills has yet to be uncovered, but increasing shipping and oil exploitation may bring along unprecedented risks of oil spills. We deployed adsorbents coated with thin oil films for up to 2.5 month in ice-covered seawater and sea ice in Godthaab Fjord, SW Greenland, to simulate and investigate in situ biodegradation and photooxidation of dispersed oil. GC-MS-based chemometric methods for oil fingerprinting were used to identify characteristic signatures for dissolution, biodegradation and photooxidation. In sub-zero temperature seawater, fast degradation of n-alkanes was observed with estimated half-life times of ‚àº7 days. PCR amplicon sequencing and qPCR quantification of bacterial genes showed that a biofilm with a diverse microbial community colonised the oil films, yet a population related to the psychrophilic hydrocarbonoclastic gammaproteobacterium Oleispira antarctica seemed to play a key role in n-alkane degradation. Although Oleispira populations were also present in sea ice, we found that biofilms in sea ice had 25 to 100 times lower bacterial densities than in seawater, which explained the non-detectable n-alkane degradation in sea ice. Fingerprinting revealed that photooxidation, but not biodegradation, transformed polycyclic aromatic compounds through 50‚ÄØcm-thick sea ice and in the upper water column with removal rates up to ‚àº1\% per day. Overall, our results showed a fast biodegradation of n-alkanes in sea ice-covered seawater, but suggested that oils spills will expose the Arctic ecosystem to bio-recalcitrant PACs over prolonged periods of time.},

	abstract = {Autochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) is increasingly released in lakes due to eutrophication, and thus affects the composition and environmental behaviors of DOM in eutrophic lakes. However, there are only limited studies on the molecular characteristics of autochthonous DOM and its influencing mechanisms. Herein, end-member DOM samples of macrophytes, algae, sediments and freshwater DOM samples in eutrophic lakes (Ch:Taihu and Dianchi) were collected and characterized by optical spectroscopy and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). The results revealed the chemical structures of autochthonous DOM were more aliphatic and less oxidized, which was marked by increases in lipid compounds and decreases in the lignin components as compared to the allochthonous DOM-dominated freshwaters. More specially, algae-derived DOM contains more lipid compounds, while macrophyte-derived DOM was dominated by lignin and tannin compounds according to Van Krevelen plots. Sediment-derived DOM contained more N-containing compounds. The traditional optical indices indicated the relative aromaticity covaried with polyphenolic and polycyclic aromatics, whereas those reflecting autochthonous DOM covaried with more aliphatic compounds. Multivariate analysis of FT-ICR-MS data of end-members and freshwaters revealed the predominant terrestrial input to Lake Taihu and greater contribution of algae released DOM to Dianchi. This study provides critical information about the characteristics of autochthonous DOM at a molecular level and confirmed autochthonous DOM was compositionally distinct from allochthonous DOM. Overall autochthonous DOM should be gained more attention in the eutrophic lakes.},

To the best of our knowledge, no study has explored the effects of salinity on salt lake DOM composition at the molecular level. In this work, we selected Qinghai Lake (QHL) and Daihai Lake (DHL) as typical saline lakes. The two lakes have similar geographical and climatic conditions, and the salinity of QHL is higher than that of DHL. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry coupled with electrospray ionization was applied to compare the DOM molecular composition in the two lakes. At higher salinity, the DOM showed larger average molecular weight, higher oxidation degree, and lower aromaticity. Moreover, the proportion of DOM that is vulnerable to microbial degradation (e.g., lipids), photo-degradation (e.g., aromatic structures), or both processes (e.g., carbohydrates and unsaturated hydrocarbons) reduced at higher salinity. On the contrary, compounds that are refractory to microbial degradation (e.g., lignins/CRAM-like structures and tannins) or photo-degradation (e.g., aliphatic compounds) accumulated. Our study provides a useful and unique method to study DOM molecular composition in salt lakes with different salinity and is helpful to understand DOM transformation during the salinization of salt lakes.},

Research to date has primarily focused on the regional impacts to biological activity and global impacts on atmospheric processes. The current project considers the molecular-level composition of organic carbon within sea ice compared to the organic matter in seawater. The project revealed that the composition of organic matter within sea ice was more variable than the composition of organic matter within the surface ocean. Furthermore, sea ice samples presented two distinct patterns in the composition of organic matter with a portion of the sea ice samples containing protein-like organic matter. Yet, the samples were collected in the early winter period when little biological activity is expected. Thus, one hypothesis is that physical processes acting during the formation of sea ice selectively transferred organic matter from seawater into sea ice. The present project expands our understanding of dissolved organic matter in sea ice and surface seawater and thereby increases our knowledge of carbon cycling in polar regions.},

Rather than being mostly a function of molecular structure, as has been assumed, soil organic carbon stability is an ecosystem property. This means that it arises from complex interactions among many biotic and abiotic factors that are not fully understood.

DOM released from phytoplankton consists of a myriad of compounds that span a range of biological reactivity from labile to recalcitrant. Linking specific bacterioplankton lineages to the incorporation of DOM compounds into biomass is important to understand microbial niche partitioning. We conducted a series of DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments using 13C-labeled substrates of varying lability including amino acids, cyanobacteria lysate, and DOM from diatom and cyanobacteria isolates concentrated on solid phase extraction PPL columns (SPE-DOM). Amendments of substrates into Sargasso Sea bacterioplankton communities were conducted to explore microbial response and DNA-SIP was used to determine which lineages of Bacteria and Archaea were responsible for uptake and incorporation. Greater increases in bacterioplankton abundance and DOC removal were observed in incubations amended with cyanobacteria-derived lysate and amino acids compared to the SPE-DOM, suggesting that the latter retained proportionally more recalcitrant DOM compounds. DOM across a range of bioavailability was utilized by diverse prokaryotic taxa with copiotrophs becoming the most abundant 13C-incorporating taxa in the amino acid treatment and oligotrophs becoming the most abundant 13C-incorporating taxa in SPE-DOM treatments. The lineages that responded to SPE-DOM amendments were also prevalent in the mesopelagic of the Sargasso Sea, suggesting that PPL extraction of phytoplankton-derived DOM isolates compounds of ecological relevance to oligotrophic heterotrophic bacterioplankton. Our study indicates that DOM quality is an important factor controlling the diversity of the microbial community response, providing insights into the roles of different bacterioplankton in resource exploitation and efficiency of marine carbon cycling.},

In this study, we provide first insight into the molecular composition of DOM associated with Indian Ocean hydrothermal systems covering the full range from hot focussed endmember fluids over diffuse fluids to open ocean hydrothermal plumes and deep seawater. We combined geochemical analyses with molecular characterization of DOM using ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). We studied two vent systems with fluids venting {\textgreater}330‚ÄØ¬∞C and up to 97\% of hydrothermal endmember: the Kairei vents (Central Indian Ridge) with brine phase separation, and the newly discovered Pelagia vents (South-East Indian Ridge). The hot fluids in both systems were highly enriched in dissolved Fe, Si, K, Li, Mn and Zn compared to seawater. The molecular composition of DOM from hot fluids differed substantially from that of diffuse fluids and plumes, in which the composition was highly dominated by the seawater DOM signature. Low O/C ratio average in hot fluids ({\textless}0.38) indicated potential input of more reduced (O-poor) DOM compounds from the vents into the surrounding seawater, independently of the vent location and of whether the fluid has undergone phase separation. To test the importance of pure thermal degradation, we compared our samples to fluids subjected to abiotic thermal degradation under laboratory conditions and we observed that our natural samples largely differed ({\textgreater}94\% Bray Curtis dissimilarity) from the experimental ones, suggesting additional degradation processes of organic compounds at the Indian Ocean hydrothermal systems.},

Ultramafic-hosted systems, however, appear to be restricted to slow-spreading ridges and constitute only a fraction of the hydrothermal systems found there. In this note, the hydrothermal fluxes of methane and hydrogen have been calculated by estimating the percentages of the total subsurface hydrothermal circulation that circulate through each type of host rock. Even though the percentage of the total subsurface flow that is affected by serpentinization appears to be rather small (8\%), it still appears that this process produces about 70\% of the total mid-ocean flux of these gases. The total production of methane and hydrogen is calculated to be about 20 √ó 109 mol yr‚àí1 and 190 √ó 109 mol yr‚àí1, respectively. The hydrogen flux is comparable to that most recently calculated on the basis of the rate of hydration of mantle rock in newly formed crust and the stoichiometry of the serpentinization reaction. This suggests that, except for the production of methane, a major portion of the hydrogen produced in the subsurface is not consumed before venting.},

Lacking a complete understanding of the composition of organic material cycled by zooplankton, the breadth of their biogeochemical and ecological contributions to aquatic ecosystems is uncertain. Here, we show that large-bodied zooplankton communities from three diverse biomes across North America release dissolved organic matter (DOM) that is chemically complex. We applied optical techniques and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to samples of DOM released by zooplankton in leachate incubations and compared these to the composition of aquatic DOM from ambient environments. The leachates captured the DOM released from zooplankton before exposure to environmental conditions that alter its chemical composition. Surprisingly, leachates from all sites contained substantial quantities of all five major fluorescence peaks representing distinct DOM compositions. When averaged, leachates consistently had low optical absorbance and elevated protein-like fluorescence, relative to lake water. Ultrahigh-resolution characterization showed that leachate DOM contained over 7000 detected molecular formulae (MF), many of which were N- and S- rich, with‚Äâ{\textgreater}‚Äâ10\% MF unique to the leachate and not detected in lake DOM. Together, these results help to define the composition of animal DOM inputs, a widely-overlooked end-member in aquatic DOM studies. Given the chemical breadth of zooplankton-derived DOM, this source may partially explain how N- and S- rich, reduced MF persist in these environments. These findings further underscore the rich chemical diversity of linkages between animals and lower trophic levels.},

It originates largely from marine biota, but it contains more than a thousand times more carbon than all living organisms in the oceans combined. Accumulation occurs because a small fraction of fixed carbon resists microbial mineralization in the ocean for millennia. The reason behind the long-term stability of DOM remains unknown. In this chapter, current hypotheses are discussed. Most likely, an interplay of different mechanisms cause some organic molecules to persist in the ocean for several thousand years. Shortage of essential nutrients, food web mechanisms, and gradients in microbial community structure may cause an accumulation of DOM over months to decades. During this intermediate accumulation, DOM can be subject to secondary, stabilizing abiotic modifications. An alternative idea proposes extreme substrate dilution as a stabilization mechanism, suggesting DOM stability may be independent of molecular structure.},

	abstract = {Simple alkyl thiols such as methanethiol (CH3SH) are widely speculated to form in seafloor hot spring fluids. Putative CH3SH synthesis by abiotic (nonbiological) reduction of inorganic carbon (CO2 or CO) has been invoked as an initiation reaction for the emergence of protometabolism and microbial life in primordial hydrothermal settings. Thiols are also presumptive ligands for hydrothermal trace metals and potential fuels for associated microbial communities. In an effort to constrain sources and sinks of CH3SH in seafloor hydrothermal systems, we determined for the first time its abundance in diverse hydrothermal fluids emanating from ultramafic, mafic, and sediment-covered midocean ridge settings. Our data demonstrate that the distribution of CH3SH is inconsistent with metastable equilibrium with inorganic carbon, indicating that production by abiotic carbon reduction is more limited than previously proposed. CH3SH concentrations are uniformly low (‚àº10‚àí8 M) in high-temperature fluids ({\textgreater}200 ¬∞C) from all unsedimented systems and, in many cases, suggestive of metastable equilibrium with CH4 instead. Associated low-temperature fluids ({\textless}200 ¬∞C) formed by admixing of seawater, however, are invariably enriched in CH3SH (up to ‚àº10‚àí6 M) along with and low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons relative to high-temperature source fluids, resembling our observations from a sediment-hosted system. This strongly implicates thermogenic interactions between upwelling fluids and microbial biomass or associated dissolved organic matter during subsurface mixing in crustal aquifers. Widespread thermal degradation of subsurface organic matter may be an important source of organic production in unsedimented hydrothermal systems and may influence microbial metabolic strategies in cooler near-seafloor and plume habitats.},

	abstract = {Abiogenic methane may be produced in submarine hydrothermal systems by degassing of basalts or serpentinization of ultramaÔ¨Åc outcrops. The latter process presumably releases little primordial helium and is therefore implicated by high CH4/3He ratios in vent Ô¨Çuids from the ultramaÔ¨Åc-hosted Rainbow Ô¨Åeld and in methane plumes near ultramaÔ¨Åc outcrops. In two segments of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, at 5.4¬∞N and 51¬∞N, we have observed depth-separated CH4 and 3He plumes. In both cases, the helium plume was deeper, near the valley Ô¨Çoor. It may be that the plumes issue from separate vents, where the helium is discharged near the volcanic axis and the methane is generated by serpentinization on the valley wall. However, at the present time the locations of the vents that produce these plumes are not known. Using a one-pass model, we investigated whether separate venting could arise from heat conduction from a primary, helium-carrying, hydrothermal circulation to a second, shallower fracture loop intersecting ultramaÔ¨Åc rock. The model results indicate that the Ô¨Çow rate through the secondary loop would have to be relatively low in order for it to stay warm enough for serpentinization to proceed. In this case, some of the exothermic heat production is lost by conduction, and the temperature increase in the circulating Ô¨Çuid is only a fraction of that expected from a water/rock ratio of 1:1.},

	abstract = {Photosynthesis and respiration impart distinct isotopic signatures to the atmosphere that are used to constrain global carbon source/sink estimates and partition ecosystem fluxes. Increasingly, the ‚ÄúKeeling plot‚Äù method is being used to determine the carbon isotope composition of ecosystem respiration (Œ¥13CR) in order to better understand the processes controlling ecosystem isotope discrimination. In this paper we synthesize emergent patterns in Œ¥13CR by analyzing 146 Keeling plots constructed at 33 sites across North and South America. In order to interpret results from disparate studies, we discuss the assumptions underlying the Keeling plot method and recommend standardized methods for determining Œ¥13CR. These include the use of regression calculations that account for error in the x variable, and constraining estimates of Œ¥13CR to nighttime periods. We then recalculate Œ¥13CR uniformly for all sites. We found a high degree of temporal and spatial variability in C3 ecosystems, with individual observations ranging from ‚àí19.0 to ‚àí32.6‚Ä∞. Mean C3 ecosystem discrimination was 18.3‚Ä∞. Precipitation was a major driver of both temporal and spatial variability of Œ¥13CR, suggesting (1) a large influence of recently fixed carbon on ecosystem respiration and (2) a significant effect of previous climatic effects on Œ¥13CR. These results illustrate the importance of water availability as a key control on atmospheric 13CO2 and highlight the potential of Œ¥13CR as a useful tool for integrating environmental effects on dynamic canopy and ecosystem processes.},

At locations far removed from terrestrial plants and the influence of cities, the concentration and C13 abundance of carbon dioxide in the air are found to be nearly constant; but the O18 abundance of carbon dioxide, under various circumstances, appears to show a systematic variation with air temperature, ocean water temperature, or season. Extreme values are, concentration: from 0.0303 to 0.0320 volume per cent of original air; C13C12 ratio: from ‚àí6.7 to ‚àí7.4 per mil; O18O16 ratio: ‚àí0.8 to ‚àí0.6 per mil. A correlation between C13 abundance and concentration of carbon dioxide previously observed for forest air is again observed. On the basis of this correlation, the C13C12 ratio of the carbon dioxide released by the forest plants has been computed and is found to vary for different stations between ‚àí21 and ‚àí26 per mil. The O18 abundance of carbon dioxide in forest air is observed to be variable but shows no simple relationship with other measured quantities.},

The hydrothermal field is venting up to 320¬∞ C hot black smoker fluids near the summit of an axial volcanic ridge. Even though the active chimneys have grown on a basaltic ridge, geochemical fluid data show a strong sedimentary influence into the hydrothermal circulation at Loki‚Äôs Castle. Compelling evidence for a sediment input is given by high alkalinity, high concentrations of NH4+, H2, CH4, C2+ hydrocarbons as well as low Mn and Fe contents. The low Œ¥13C values of CO2 and CH4 and the thermogenic isotopic pattern of the C2+ hydrocarbons in the high-temperature vent fluids clearly point to thermal degradation of sedimentary organic matter and illustrate diminution of the natural carbon sequestration in sediments by hydrothermal circulation. Thus, carbon-release to the hydrosphere in Arctic regions is especially relevant in areas where the active Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge system is in contact with the organic matter rich detrital sediment fans.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the distribution and abundance of viruses at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Based on estimates made using epifluorescence microscopy and the dye YoPro-1, much higher viral abundances were observed at active hydrothermal vents than in the surrounding deep sea. This indicates that viral production was occurring and that viruses were a source of microbial mortality. Samples collected from three actively venting sites (Clam Bed, S\&M and Salut) within the Endeavour Ridge system off the west coast of North America had viral abundances ranging from 1.45√ó105 to 9.90√ó107 ml‚àí1, while the abundances of prokaryotes ranged from 1.30√ó105 to 4.46√ó106 ml‚àí1. The abundances of viruses and prokaryotes in samples collected along the neutrally buoyant plume associated with the Main Endeavour Field were lower than at actively venting sites, with a mean of 5.3√ó105 prokaryotes ml‚àí1 (s.d. 2.9√ó105, n=64) and 3.50√ó106 viruses ml‚àí1 (s.d. 1.89√ó106, n=64), but were higher than non-plume samples (2.7√ó105 prokaryotes ml‚àí1, s.d. 5.0√ó104, n=15 and 2.94√ó106 viruses ml‚àí1, s.d. 1.08√ó106, n=15). Prokaryotic and viral abundances in non-hydrothermal regions were as much as 10-fold higher than found in previous studies, in which sample fixation likely resulted in underestimates. This suggests that viral infection may be a greater source of prokaryotic mortality throughout the deep sea than previously recognized. Overall, our results indicate that virus-mediated mortality of prokaryotes at these hydrothermal-vent environments is significant and may reduce energy flow to higher trophic levels.},

Net samples taken in July of 1991 and 1992 show that the standing stock of macrozooplankton integrated over the water column was considerably higher within several kilometers of the main vent site than at locations tens of kilometers from the vent site. Community analysis reveals that there were distinct shallow ({\textless}800 m depth) and deep ({\textgreater}800 m depth) faunal assemblages in the vent region. Shallow fauna infiltrated the deep zooplankton acoustic scattering layers in the immediate vicinity of Endeavour Ridge, producing a mixed assemblage of animals, including large numbers of juvenile filter-feeding copepods and their predators that normally inhabit the shallow layer. In contrast, the deep acoustic scattering layers found 11 km to the southeast and 15 km to the north of the central vent field in 1991, and 50 km to the west of the central vent field in 1992, were composed of distinctly deep-sea fauna. The enhanced, vertically-integrated biomass over the vent region appears to result from vertical migration of zooplankton. A simple circulation model indicates that fauna can make the round-trip journey between the top of the plume and the upper ocean without being advected beyond the range of the detectable hydrothermal effluent.},

Active submarine vent fields are now known along the boundaries of 46 out of 52 recognized tectonic plates. Hydrothermal survey efforts over the most recent decade were sparked by national and commercial interests in the mineral resource potential of seafloor hydrothermal deposits, as well as by academic research. Here we incorporate recent data for back-arc spreading centers and ultraslow- and slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges (MORs) to revise a linear equation relating the frequency of vent fields along oceanic spreading ridges to spreading rate. We apply this equation globally to predict a total number of vent fields on spreading ridges, which suggests that {\textasciitilde}900 vent fields remain to be discovered. Almost half of these undiscovered vent fields (comparable to the total of all vent fields discovered during 35 years of research) are likely to occur at MORs with full spreading rates less than 60mm/yr. We then apply the equation regionally to predict where these hydrothermal vents may be discovered with respect to plate boundaries and national jurisdiction, with the majority expected to occur outside of states' exclusive economic zones. We hope that these predictions will prove useful to the community in the future, in helping to shape continuing ridge-crest exploration.},

Recent research has uncovered fundamental aspects of these microbial communities, including their relationships with underlying geology and hydrothermal geochemistry, interactions with animals via symbiosis and distribution both locally in various habitats within vent fields and globally across hydrothermal systems in diverse settings. Although ‚Äòblack smokers‚Äô and symbioses between microorganisms and macrofauna attract much attention owing to their novelty and the insights they provide into life under extreme conditions, habitats such as regions of diffuse flow, subseafloor aquifers and hydrothermal plumes have important roles in the global cycling of elements through hydrothermal systems. Owing to sharp contrasts in physical and chemical conditions between these various habitats and their dynamic, extreme and geographically isolated nature, hydrothermal vents provide a valuable window into the environmental and ecological forces that shape microbial communities and insights into the limits, origins and¬†evolution of microbial life.},

	abstract = {The Flores diving cruise was part of the MAST III-AMORES (1995 ‚Äì 1998) program funded by the European Union. One of the major achievements of the Flores cruise was the discovery of the Rainbow hydrothermal field hosted in ultramafic rocks south of the Amar segment on the Mid-Atlantic ridge (MAR). The Rainbow hydrothermal fluids exhibit temperatures of 365 jC, pH of 2.8, high chlorinity (750 mmol/kg), and low silica (6.9 mmol/kg). The uniformity in endmember major, minor, trace element concentrations and gas contents suggests that all Rainbow fluids originate from the same deep source. Although H2S content is relatively low (1.20 mmol/kg), all vent fluids show extraordinary high H2 (16 mmol/kg), CH4 (2.5 mmol/kg) and CO (5 Amol/kg) endmember concentrations compared to fluids collected from other vent sites along the MAR. Hydrogen represents more than 40\% of the total gas volume extracted from the fluids. At Rainbow, H2 production is likely associated with alteration of olivine and orthopyroxene minerals during serpentinization. Given that exposures of ultramafic rock may be common, particularly along slow-spreading ridges, the production of H2 may have important implications for microbial activity at and beneath the seafloor.

	abstract = {The radiative forcings and global warming potentials for 39 greenhouse gases are evaluated using narrowband and broadband radiative transfer models. Unlike many previous studies, latitudinal and seasonal variations are considered explicitly, using distributions of major greenhouse gases from a combination of chemical-transport model results and Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) measurements and cloud statistics from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project. The gases examined include CO2, CH4, N2O, plus a number of chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, hydrochlorocarbons, bromocarbons, iodocarbons, and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). The model calculations are performed on a 5¬∞ latitude grid from 82.5¬∞S to 82.5¬∞N. The radiative forcings determined by the model are then used to derive global warming potential for each of the compounds, which are compared with prior analyses. In addition, the latitudinal and seasonal dependence of radiative forcing since preindustrial time is calculated. The vertical profiles of the gases are found to be important in determining the radiative forcings; the use of height-independent vertical distributions of greenhouse gases, as used in many previous studies, produce errors of several percent in estimated radiative forcings for gases studied here; the errors for the short-lived compounds are relatively higher. Errors in evaluated radiative forcings caused by neglecting both the seasonal and the latitudinal distributions of greenhouse gases and atmospheres are generally smaller than those due to height-independent vertical distributions. Our total radiative forcing due to increase in major greenhouse gas concentrations for the period 1765‚Äì1992 is 2.32 Wm‚àí2, only 2\% higher than other recent estimates; however, the differences for individual gases are as large as 23\%.},

	abstract = {Abstract. We examine the sensitivity of a climate model to a wide range of radiative forcings, including changes of solar irradiance, atmospheric CO2, 03, CFCs, clouds, aerosols, surface ‚Ä¢bedo, and a "ghost " forcing introduced at arbitrary heights, latitudes, longitudes, seasons, and times of day. We show that, in general, the climate response, specifically the global mean temperature change, is sensitive to the altitude, latitude, and nature of the forcing; that is, the response to a given forcing can vary by 50 \% or more depending upon characteristics of the forcing other than its magnitude measured in watts per square meter. The consistency of the response among different forcings is higher, within 20 \% or better, for most of the globally distributed forcingsuspected of influencinglobal mean temperature in the past century, but exceptions occur for certain changes of ozone or absorbing aerosols, for which the climate response is less well behaved. In ‚Ä¢1 cases the physic ‚Ä¢ basis for the variations of the response can be understood.

The highest Œî14C values for both DOC (up to ‚àí29‚Ä∞) and POC (up to 78‚Ä∞) were observed in relatively low-salinity shelf waters. The Œî14C values for DOC from the shelf and shallow (‚àº5m depth) slope generally increased progressively with proximity to the coast, and along-shelf from northeast to southwest. A significant system-wide increase in Œî14C-DOC values occurred between spring and summer 1996, indicating a major flux of young DOC to the MAB over this timeframe. The lowest Œî14C-DOC values (as low as ‚àí476‚Ä∞) were found in deep (‚â≥300m depth) slope waters, and they were lower than values measured previously at similar depths in the open North Atlantic. A significant inverse relationship was found between Œî14C-DOC and Œ¥13C-DOC for shelf and shallow slope waters, which we speculate may be due to variable contributions of young, 14C-enriched organic matter of terrestrial and/or riverine origin. The suspended POC of shelf and shallow slope waters was isotopically distinct from DOC, and exhibited little of the characteristic areal variability of DOC concentrations and Œî14C across the MAB. In deep slope waters, suspended POC had the greatest ages ever observed for water column POC in any marine system. These 14C-depleted POC values correlated positively and significantly with Œ¥13C-POC values, which ranged from ‚àí31‚Ä∞ to ‚àí23‚Ä∞ in deep slope waters. A multiple-source dual isotopic mass balance model was applied to the observed Œî14C and Œ¥13C distributions to evaluate the potential sources of DOC and POC to shelf and slope waters of the MAB. With the exception of the highly 14C- and 13C-depleted POC from the deep slope, all other DOC and POC values could be constrained by the isotopic signatures of various potential source materials measured for the MAB region. These include varying contributions from potential sources of open ocean, terrestrial and riverine, and bottom nepheloid layer colloidal organic matter, as well as from recent shelf and slope primary production.},

Second, studies of known methanogens under low hydrogen and high methane conditions were unable to induce methane oxidation, indicating that ‚Äòreverse methanogenesis‚Äô is not a widespread process in methanogens. Third, lipid biomarker studies detected isotopically depleted archaeal and bacterial biomarkers from marine methane vents, and indicate that Archaea are the primary consumers of methane. Finally, phylogenetic studies indicate that only specific groups of Archaea and SRB are involved in methane oxidation.

Now again, understanding the biological and biochemical details of AOM is the declared goal of several interational research groups, but this time in a combined effort of biogeochemists and microbiologists using novel analytical tools tailored for the study of unknown microbes and habitats.

	abstract = {Cold-seep benthic communities in the Arctic exist at the nexus of two extreme environments; one reflecting the harsh physical extremes of the Arctic environment and another reflecting the chemical extremes and strong environmental gradients associated with seafloor seepage of methane and toxic sulfide-enriched sediments. Recent ecological investigations of cold seeps at numerous locations on the margins of the Arctic Ocean basin reveal that seabed seepage of reduced gas and fluids strongly influence benthic communities and associated marine ecosystems. These Arctic seep communities are mostly different from both conventional Arctic benthic communities as well as cold-seep systems elsewhere in the world. They are characterized by a lack of large specialized chemo-obligate polychetes and mollusks often seen at non-Arctic seeps, but, nonetheless, have substantially higher benthic abundance and biomass compared to adjacent Arctic areas lacking seeps. Arctic seep communities are dominated by expansive tufts or meadows of siboglinid polychetes, which can reach densities up to {\textgreater}3 √ó 105 ind.m‚Äì2. The enhanced autochthonous chemosynthetic production, combined with reef-like structures from methane-derived authigenic carbonates, provides a rich and complex local habitat that results in aggregations of non-seep specialized fauna from multiple trophic levels, including several commercial species. Cold seeps are far more widespread in the Arctic than thought even a few years ago. They exhibit in situ benthic chemosynthetic production cycles that operate on different spatial and temporal cycles than the sunlight-driven counterpart of photosynthetic production in the ocean‚Äôs surface. These systems can act as a spatio-temporal bridge for benthic communities and associated ecosystems that may otherwise suffer from a lack of consistency in food quality from the surface ocean during seasons of low production. As climate change impacts accelerate in Arctic marginal seas, photosynthetic primary production cycles are being modified, including in terms of changes in the timing, magnitude, and quality of photosynthetic carbon, whose delivery to the seabed fuels benthic communities. Furthermore, an increased northward expansion of species is expected as a consequence of warming seas. This may have implications for dispersal and evolution of both chemosymbiotic species as well as for background taxa in the entire realm of the Arctic Ocean basin and fringing seas.},

These differences may be interpreted directly and mistakenly as the timescale of circulation. The characterization of the deep ocean circulation being millennial is common. Using objectively gridded, natural Œî14C ‚Äúdata‚Äù of Key et al.

The new distribution of ‚Äúcirculation 14C ages‚Äù is more consistent with the deep ocean being characterized by a centennial timescale than a millennial timescale. Also, the role of the southern sourced deep water is now made more obvious. By accounting for the two important controls on oceanic 14C that are not well known outside the field of chemical oceanography, the new map will be useful as an illustration of global deep ocean circulation to the wider scientific community and as a pedagogical tool to new students in Earth sciences and oceanography.},

	abstract = {Measurements of dissolved methane and hydrogen from the Atlantic Ocean, between 50¬∞N and 35¬∞S, showed the surface water to be supersaturated, while the deep ocean water was in equilibrium or slightly undersaturated with respect to atmospheric CH4 and H2. Dissolved H2 was highest in surface water and decreased within the upper 100 m of the water column, whereas dissolved CH4 remained high within the entire euphotic water layer. There is evience for a diurnal variation of dissolved H2, with higher amplitudes at the water surface compared to 20m depth. Dissolved CH4 at 4 m depth also was measured using a continuously working equilibration technique which procided information on short-term fluctuations. The dissolved CH4 showed no diurnal variations and was independent of wind speed. Highest CH4 concentrations were observed in areas with high nutrient input, e.g. in the upwelling areas off West Africa, and correlated well with the observed chorophyll a concentrations. Based on an average CH4 saturation factor of about 1.1, the total source strength for atmospheric CH4 is calculated to about 1.5 Tg y‚àí1.},

The analysis uses the GAINS model framework to estimate emissions, mitigation potentials and costs for all major sources of anthropogenic methane for 83 countries/regions, which are aggregated to produce global estimates. Global emissions are estimated at 323 Mt methane in 2005, with an expected increase to 414 Mt methane in 2030. The technical mitigation potential is estimated at 195 Mt methane in 2030, whereof about 80 percent is found attainable at a marginal cost less than 20 Euro t‚àí1 CO2eq when using a social planner cost perspective. With a private investor cost perspective, the corresponding fraction is only 30 percent. Major uncertainty sources in emission estimates are identiÔ¨Åed and discussed.},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {Both hydrogen and methane are consistently discharged in large quantities in hydrothermal Ô¨Çuids issued from ultramaÔ¨Åc-hosted hydrothermal Ô¨Åelds discovered along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Considering the vast number of these Ô¨Åelds discovered or inferred, hydrothermal Ô¨Çuxes represent a signiÔ¨Åcant input of H2 and CH4 to the ocean. Although there are lines of evidence of their abiogenic formation from stable C and H isotope results, laboratory experiments, and thermodynamic data, neither their origin nor the reaction pathways generating these gases have been fully constrained yet. Organic compounds detected in the Ô¨Çuids may also be derived from abiotic reactions. Although thermodynamics are favorable and extensive experimental work has been done on FischerTropsch-type reactions, for instance, nothing is clear yet about their origin and formation mechanism from actual data. Since chemolithotrophic microbial communities commonly colonize hydrothermal vents, biogenic and thermogenic processes are likely to contribute to the production of H2, CH4, and other organic compounds. There seems to be a consensus toward a mixed origin (both sources and processes) that is consistent with the ambiguous nature of the isotopic data. But the question that remains is, to what proportions? More systematic experiments as well as integrated geochemical approaches are needed to disentangle hydrothermal geochemistry. This understanding is of prime importance considering the implications of hydrothermal H2, CH4, and organic compounds for the ocean global budget, global cycles, and the origin of life.

In addition to transporting a great amount of methane toward the seafloor, cold seeps also contribute to the aged, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool in the deep ocean. Here, two sediment cores from the ‚ÄúHaima cold seeps,‚Äù northern South China Sea and a nearby reference core were analyzed for pore-water sulfate and DOC concentrations, Œ¥13C of DOC, and optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM). High DOC concentrations (0.9‚Äì3.7 mM) accompanied by extremely low Œ¥13C values (‚àí43.9 to ‚àí76.2‚Ä∞) suggest the conversion of methane into sedimentary DOC pool in the seep sediments. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of the fluorescence excitation-emission matrices shows higher fluorescent intensities of labile protein-like components (C2 and C4) and lower fluorescent intensities of refractory humic-like components (C1 and C3) in the seep cores compared to the reference core. The intensity of C2 is positively correlated with DOC concentrations and Œ¥13C-DOC in the seep sediments, suggesting that the labile protein-like DOM was produced by the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Moreover, low humification index (HIX) and high biological index (BIX) values also indicate intensified production of relatively labile DOM with lower degradation degree in the seep cores compared to the reference core. Hence, we highlight that methane-derived DOC may serve as important carbon and energy sources for heterotrophic microbial communities due to its relatively labile nature.},

An analysis of nearly 30 years of unpublished records of the oxygen isotope (18O/16O) composition of atmospheric carbon dioxide from sampling sites worldwide has provided a means of estimating the GPP that is not reliant on modelling. The data reveal previously unrecognized interannual fluctuations that are driven by El Ni√±o climate events. The effect propagates from the tropics to higher latitudes through the tropical hydrological cycle. Recovery from El Ni√±o events is rapid, implying a shorter turnover time for CO2 than is generally assumed, and suggests a best-guess figure for global GPP of 150‚Äì175 petagrams of carbon per year, rather than the current estimate of 120 petagrams.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 has increased at a nearly identical average rate of 3.3 and 3.2 Pg C yr‚àí1 for the decades of the 1980s and the 1990s, in spite of a large increase in fossil fuel emissions from 5.4 to 6.3 Pg C yr‚àí1. Thus, the sum of the ocean and land CO2 sinks was 1 Pg C yr‚àí1 larger in the 1990s than in to the 1980s. Here we quantify the ocean and land sinks for these two decades using recent atmospheric inversions and ocean models. The ocean and land sinks are estimated to be, respectively, 0.3 (0.1 to 0.6) and 0.7 (0.4 to 0.9) Pg C yr‚àí1 larger in the 1990s than in the 1980s. When variability less than 5 yr is removed, all estimates show a global oceanic sink more or less steadily increasing with time, and a large anomaly in the land sink during 1990‚Äì1994. For year-to-year variability, all estimates show 1/3 to 1/2 less variability in the ocean than on land, but the amplitude and phase of the oceanic variability remain poorly determined. A mean oceanic sink of 1.9 Pg C yr‚àí1 for the 1990s based on O2 observations corrected for ocean outgassing is supported by these estimates, but an uncertainty on the mean value of the order of ¬±0.7 Pg C yr‚àí1 remains. The difference between the two decades appears to be more robust than the absolute value of either of the two decades.},

	abstract = {We examined the mineralogical, chemical and isotopic compositions of secondary fluid inclusions in olivine-rich rocks from two active serpentinization systems: the Von Damm hydrothermal field (Mid-Cayman Rise) and the Zambales ophiolite (Philippines). Peridotite, troctolite and gabbroic rocks in these systems contain abundant CH4-rich secondary inclusions in olivine, with less abundant inclusions in plagioclase and clinopyroxene. Olivine-hosted secondary inclusions are chiefly composed of CH4 and minor H2, in addition to secondary minerals including serpentine, brucite, magnetite and carbonates. Secondary inclusions in plagioclase are dominated by CH4 with variable amounts of H2 and H2O, while those in clinopyroxene contain only CH4. We determined hydrocarbon abundances and stable carbon isotope compositions by crushing whole rocks and analysing the released volatiles using isotope ratio monitoring‚Äîgas chromatography mass spectrometry. Bulk rock gas analyses yielded appreciable quantities of CH4 and C2H6 in samples from Cayman (4‚Äì313‚Äânmol‚Äâg‚àí1 CH4 and 0.02‚Äì0.99‚Äânmol‚Äâg‚àí1 C2H6), with lesser amounts in samples from Zambales (2‚Äì37‚Äânmol‚Äâg‚àí1 CH4 and 0.004‚Äì0.082‚Äânmol‚Äâg‚àí1 C2H6). Mafic and ultramafic rocks at Cayman exhibit Œ¥13CCH4 values of ‚àí16.7‚Ä∞ to ‚àí4.4‚Ä∞ and Œ¥13CC2H6 values of ‚àí20.3‚Ä∞ to +0.7‚Ä∞. Ultramafic rocks from Zambales exhibit Œ¥13CCH4 values of ‚àí12.4‚Ä∞ to ‚àí2.8‚Ä∞ and Œ¥13CC2H6 values of ‚àí1.2‚Ä∞ to ‚àí0.9‚Ä∞. Similarities in the carbon isotopic compositions of CH4 and C2H6 in plutonic rocks, Von Damm hydrothermal fluids, and Zambales gas seeps suggest that leaching of fluid inclusions may provide a significant contribution of abiotic hydrocarbons to deep-sea vent fluids and ophiolite-hosted gas seeps. Isotopic compositions of CH4 and C2H6 from a variety of hydrothermal fields hosted in olivine-rich rocks that are similar to those in Von Damm vent fluids further support the idea that a significant portion of abiotic hydrocarbons in ultramafic-influenced vent fluids is derived from fluid inclusions.

	abstract = {Hot-spring fluids emanating from deep-sea vents hosted in unsedimented ultramafic and mafic rock commonly contain high concentrations of methane. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed for the origin(s) of this methane, ranging from synthesis via reduction of aqueous inorganic carbon (‚àëCO2) during active fluid circulation to leaching of methane-rich fluid inclusions from plutonic rocks of the oceanic crust. To further resolve the process(es) responsible for methane generation in these systems, we determined the relative abundances of several methane isotopologues (including 13CH3D, a ‚Äúclumped‚Äù isotopologue containing two rare isotope substitutions) in hot-spring source fluids sampled from four geochemically-distinct hydrothermal vent fields (Rainbow, Von Damm, Lost City, and Lucky Strike). Apparent equilibrium temperatures retrieved from methane clumped isotopologue analyses average 310-42+53‚ÄØ¬∞C, with no apparent relation to the wide range of fluid temperatures (96‚Äì370‚ÄØ¬∞C) and chemical compositions (pH, [H2], [‚àëCO2], [CH4]) represented. Combined with very similar bulk stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and D/H) of methane across the suite of hydrothermal fluids, all available geochemical and isotopic data suggest a common mechanism of methane generation at depth that is disconnected from active fluid circulation. Attainment of equilibrium amongst methane isotopologues at temperatures of ca. 270‚Äì360‚ÄØ¬∞C is compatible with the thermodynamically-favorable reduction of CO2 to CH4 at temperatures at or below ca. 400‚ÄØ¬∞C under redox conditions characterizing intrusive rocks derived from sub-ridge melts. Collectively, the observations support a model where methane-rich aqueous fluids, known to be trapped in rocks of the oceanic lithosphere, are liberated from host rocks during hydrothermal circulation and perhaps represent the major source of methane venting with thermal waters at unsedimented hydrothermal fields. The results also provide further evidence that water-rock reactions occurring at temperatures lower than 200‚ÄØ¬∞C do not contribute significantly to the quantities of methane venting at mid-ocean ridge hot springs.},

Despite the common fact that biological processes are responsible for its origin, the formation of methane in aerobic surface water is still poorly understood. We report on methane production in the central Arctic Ocean, which was exclusively detected in Pacific derived water but not nearby in Atlantic derived water. The two water masses are distinguished by their different nitrate to phosphate ratios. We show that methane production occurs if nitrate is depleted but phosphate is available as a P source. Apparently the low N:P ratio enhances the ability of bacteria to compete for phosphate while the phytoplankton metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is utilized as a C source. This was verified by experimentally induced methane production in DMSP spiked Arctic sea water. Accordingly we propose that methylated compounds may serve as precursors for methane and thermodynamic calculations show that methylotrophic methanogenesis can provide energy in aerobic environments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we used multiple complementary approaches to show that microbial methane production could and did occur in the well-oxygenated water column of an oligotrophic lake (Lake Stechlin, Germany). Oversaturation of methane was repeatedly recorded in the well-oxygenated upper 10 m of the water column, and the methane maxima coincided with oxygen oversaturation at 6 m. Laboratory incubations of unamended epilimnetic lake water and inoculations of photoautotrophs with a lake-enrichment culture both led to methane production even in the presence of oxygen, and the production was not affected by the addition of inorganic phosphate or methylated compounds. Methane production was also detected by in-lake incubations of lake water, and the highest production rate was 1.8‚Äì2.4 nM‚ãÖh‚àí1 at 6 m, which could explain 33‚Äì44\% of the observed ambient methane accumulation in the same month. Temporal and spatial uncoupling between methanogenesis and methanotrophy was supported by field and laboratory measurements, which also helped explain the oversaturation of methane in the upper water column. Potentially methanogenic Archaea were detected in situ in the oxygenated, methane-rich epilimnion, and their attachment to photoautotrophs might allow for anaerobic growth and direct transfer of substrates for methane production. Specific PCR on mRNA of the methyl coenzyme M reductase A gene revealed active methanogenesis. Microbial methane production in oxygenated water represents a hitherto overlooked source of methane and can be important for carbon cycling in the aquatic environments and water to air methane flux.},

CH4 concentrations decreased systematically from 600 nM at on-axis stations to {\textless}11 nM at a distal station 15 km off axis; background CH4 concentrations are {\textless}2 nM. CH4 behaves nonconservatively in plume waters and does not correlate with conservative parameters such as temperature anomaly (ŒîŒ∏), but is highly correlated with NH4+ and total dissolvable Mn. Œ¥ 13C‚ÄìCH4 values for plume depth samples varies inversely and significantly (R2 = 0.89) with methane concentrations normalized to ŒîŒ∏. Some Œ¥ 13C‚ÄìCH4 values (+1.8 and +10.9 ‚Ä∞) measured at the 15 km off-axis station are among the heaviest yet reported from a natural marine environment. Less than 5\% of original hydrothermal methane remains in the plume at this station. The data are consistent with extensive microbial methane oxidation. A narrow range of fractionation factors (rc ‚âà1.0072 to 1.0077) was calculated for the Endeavour samples. These fractionation factors are less than those reported by Coleman et al. (1981), but fall near the trend line of their rc versus temperature data when extrapolated to plume water temperature (‚àº2 ¬∞C).},

Smoldering commonly existing in wildfires contributes significantly to biomass consumption and gas emission, but its influence on source water quality has been rarely studied. Here, we investigated the impact of smoldering temperature (i.e., no burn, 250, 400, and 600 ¬∞C) on the nutrients, elements, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) of water extracts from the residues of the leaf needles and woody trunks of pine (Pinus jeffreyi) under the lab-simulated smoldering fire. Results showed the increase of pH and the yields of the dominated exchangeable cations of K+ and Mg2+, P, PO43‚àí-P, and SO42‚àí with increasing temperature increasing from 250 to 600 ¬∞C, whereas significant decreases in the fraction of dissolved organic C in residue C with increasing temperature and the yields of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) after burnings. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) presented consistent results with UV/fluorescence, suggesting that the unburned materials contained more biodegradable tyrosine/tryptophan/soluble microbial byproduct-like compounds with high molecular weight (MW), whereas the 600 ¬∞C-smoldering materials composed of more aromatic, humified, fulvic/humic acid-like, and oxidized compounds with a potentially high density of C=C bonds had less reactivity in forming trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetonitriles (HANs). Our study indicates the smoldering-dominated prescribed fire as a potential forest management strategy for reducing biomass fuel and disinfection byproducts (DBPs) precursors in source water from forested lands.},

Seawater over the shallow Arctic shelf is characterized by excess methane compared to atmospheric equilibrium. This methane originates in sediment, permafrost, and hydrate.

The abundance of MOB was low with maximal fractions of 2.5\&thinsp;\% at 200 times elevated methane concentration, while sequence reads of non-MOB methylotrophs were 4 times more abundant than MOB in most incubations. The abundances of MOB as well as non-MOB methylotroph sequences correlated tightly with the rate constant ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{k}$_{\textrm{ox}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) for methane oxidation, indicating that non-MOB methylotrophs might be coupled to MOB and involved in community methane oxidation.

We studied C cycling in two phytoplankton‚Äìbacteria systems (non-axenic cultures of a dinoflagellate \textit{Apocalathium malmogiense} and a cryptophyte \textit{Rhodomonas marina}) in two complementary experiments. In the first experiment we grew phytoplankton and bacteria in nutrient-replete conditions and followed C processing at early exponential growth phase and twice later when the community had grown denser. Cell-specific primary production and total community respiration were up to 4 and 7 times higher, respectively, in the \textit{A. malmogiense} treatments. Based on the optical signals, accumulating dissolved organic C (DOC) was degraded more in the \textit{R. marina} treatments, and the rate of bacterial production to primary production was higher. Thus, the flow of C from phytoplankton to bacteria was relatively higher in \textit{R. marina} treatments than in \textit{A. malmogiense} treatments, which was further supported by faster {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{14}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C transfer from phytoplankton to bacterial biomass. In the second experiment we investigated consumption of the phytoplankton-derived DOC by bacteria. DOC consumption and transformation, bacterial production, and bacterial respiration were all higher in \textit{R. marina} treatments. In both experiments \textit{A. malmogiense} supported a bacterial community predominated by bacteria specialized in the utilization of less labile DOC (class Bacteroidia), whereas \textit{R. marina} supported a community predominated by copiotrophic Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. Our findings suggest that large dinoflagellates cycle relatively more C between phytoplankton biomass and the inorganic C pool, whereas small cryptophytes direct relatively more C to the microbial loop.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In simulation studies of the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle, predicting the depth-distribution for remineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC) is of particular importance. Following Sarmiento et al. (Global Biogeochemical Cycles 7 (1993) 417), most simulation models have the power-law curve of Martin et al. (Deep-Sea Research 34 (1987) 267) for this purpose. The Martin et al. curve is an empirical fit to data, most of which is from shallow floating sediment traps. Using such a fit implies that all the information necessary for prediction is contained in the carbon flux itself, so that the organic-carbon flux FOC(z) at any depth z can be predicted from the flux of organic carbon FOC(z0) at some near-surface depth z0. Here, we challenge this basic premise, arguing that fluxes of ballast minerals (silicate and carbonate biominerals, and dust) determine deep-water POC fluxes, so that a mechanism-based model of POC flux must simultaneously predict fluxes of both POC and ballast minerals. This assertion is based on the empirical observation that POC fluxes are tightly linked quantitatively to fluxes of ballast minerals in the deep ocean. Here, we develop a model structure that incorporates this observation, and fit this model to US JGOFS EqPac data. This model structure, plus the preliminary parameter estimates we have obtained, can be used to explore the implications of our model in studies of the ocean carbon cycle.},

Substantial abundances of a suite of six steroids (four 4Œ±-methyl sterols and two 4Œ±-methyl steroid diols) and three hopanoids (diploptene, diplopterol and Œî2-diplopterol) were found, together with biomarkers from anaerobic methanotrophic consortia (ANME-3/Desulfobulbus aggregates) at the surface sediment of the mats. All of the steroid and hopanoid biomarkers, some not been described before, were substantially depleted in 13C (Œ¥13C between ‚àí77‚Ä∞ and ‚àí68‚Ä∞), proving biosynthesis by an organism involved in methane consumption. Molecular analysis (16S rRNA sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridisation) performed in a parallel study showed that, besides ANME-3/Desulfobulbus consortia, aerobic methanotrophs of the order Methylococcales are also abundant with high cell numbers. These independent findings suggest a spatially close vicinity of active aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophic communities on the order of millimetres, not reported before for the marine environment. At the centre location, where methane oxidation is performed solely by Methylococcales species, predominantly 4Œ±-methyl-3Œ≤-sterols, together with high abundances of specific fatty acids (i.e. C16:1œâ9c and C16:1œâ8c), were detected. The additional presence of new and unusual biomarkers for aerobic methanotrophy at the Beggiatoa mats seems to indicate either varying strains of Methylococcales types or an energy stress adaptation of the dominant species at the latter sampling site. Moreover, consideration is given to the new biomarkers being intermediates in the biosynthetic formation of steroids and hopanoids in methanotrophic bacteria.},

Compositional changes of DCCHO were strongest within more oxygenated waters. Compositional changes of DAA were also evident under suboxic conditions ({\textless}5 ¬µmol O2 kg‚àí1) and indicated bacterial peptide degradation. Moreover, specific free amino acids (alanine and threonine) were enhanced within suboxic waters, pointing to a potential production of dissolved organic nitrogen under suboxic conditions.

The Rainbow hydrothermal fluids exhibit temperatures of 365 jC, pH of 2.8, high chlorinity (750 mmol/kg), and low silica (6.9 mmol/kg). The uniformity in endmember major, minor, trace element concentrations and gas contents suggests that all Rainbow fluids originate from the same deep source. Although H2S content is relatively low (1.20 mmol/kg), all vent fluids show extraordinary high H2 (16 mmol/kg), CH4 (2.5 mmol/kg) and CO (5 Amol/kg) endmember concentrations compared to fluids collected from other vent sites along the MAR. Hydrogen represents more than 40\% of the total gas volume extracted from the fluids. At Rainbow, H2 production is likely associated with alteration of olivine and orthopyroxene minerals during serpentinization. Given that exposures of ultramafic rock may be common, particularly along slow-spreading ridges, the production of H2 may have important implications for microbial activity at and beneath the seafloor.

Methane's RF is particularly impacted because of the inclusion of the shortwave forcing; the 1750‚Äì2011 RF is about 25\% higher (increasing from 0.48 W m‚àí2 to 0.61 W m‚àí2) compared to the value in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2013 assessment; the 100 year global warming potential is 14\% higher than the IPCC value. We present new simplified expressions to calculate RF. Unlike previous expressions used by IPCC, the new ones include the overlap between CO2 and N2O; for N2O forcing, the CO2 overlap can be as important as the CH4 overlap. The 1750‚Äì2011 CO2 RF is within 1\% of IPCC's value but is about 10\% higher when CO2 amounts reach 2000 ppm, a value projected to be possible under the extended RCP8.5 scenario.},

Here, we review the techniques used to date and provide guidelines accessible to those new to this field or from a different molecular biology background. Optimization begins with field collection, sample preservation, predator dissection and DNA extraction techniques, all designed to ensure good quality, uncontaminated DNA from semidigested samples. The advantages of nuclear vs. mitochondrial DNA as primer targets are reviewed, along with choice of genes and advice on primer design to maximize specificity and detection periods following ingestion of the prey by the predators. Primer and assay optimization are discussed, including cross-amplification tests and calibratory feeding experiments. Once primers have been made, the screening of field samples must guard against (through appropriate controls) cross contamination. Multiplex polymerase chain reactions provide a means of screening for many different species simultaneously. We discuss visualization of amplicons on gels, with and without incorporation of fluorescent primers. In more specialized areas, we examine the utility of temperature and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to examine responses of predators to prey diversity, and review the potential of quantitative polymerase chain reaction systems to quantify predation. Alternative routes by which prey DNA might get into the guts of a predator (scavenging, secondary predation) are highlighted. We look ahead to new technologies, including microarrays and pyrosequencing, which might one day be applied to this field.},

	abstract = {The flux of terrigenous organic carbon through estuaries is an important and changing, yet poorly understood, component of the global carbon cycle. Using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and fluorescence data from 13 British estuaries draining catchments with highly variable land uses, we show that land use strongly influences the fate of DOC across the land ocean transition via its influence on the composition and lability of the constituent dissolved organic matter (DOM). In estuaries draining peatland-dominated catchments, DOC was highly correlated with biologically refractory ‚Äúhumic-like‚Äù terrigenous material which tended to be conservatively transported along the salinity gradient. In contrast, there was a weaker correlation between DOC and DOM components within estuaries draining catchments with a high degree of human impact, that is, relatively larger percentage of arable and (sub)urban land uses. These arable and (sub)urban estuaries contain a high fraction of bioavailable ‚Äúprotein-like‚Äù material that behaved nonconservatively, with both DOC removals and additions occurring. In general, estuaries draining catchments with a high percentage of peatland (‚â•18\%) have higher area-specific estuarine exports of DOC ({\textgreater}13 g C m‚àí2 yr‚àí1) compared to those estuaries draining catchments with a high percentage (‚â•46\%) of arable and (sub)urban land uses ({\textless}2.1 g C m‚àí2 yr‚àí1). Our data indicate that these arable and (sub)urban estuaries tend to export, on average, ‚àº50\% more DOC to coastal areas than they receive from rivers due to net anthropogenic derived organic matter inputs within the estuary.},

Herein, we integrated data from the dark South China, Mediterranean and Japan Seas (temperature range: 0.09‚Äì15.1¬∞C) to demonstrate that in situ production efficiency of two ubiquitous humic-like fluorophores increased at higher dark ocean temperature, whereas chromophores at a wavelength of 325 nm (aCDOM(325)) changed from production to degradation at higher temperature. Increased oxygen consumption and a reduction of labile substrates in future warmer dark ocean environments may initiate the final degradation of some semi-refractory components, thereby increasing the recalcitrance of RDOM, but decreasing the DOM inventory in dark basins and creating a positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO2.},

	abstract = {In the past few decades, chemosynthetic ecosystems at deep-sea hydrothermal vents have received attention as plausible analogues to the early ecosystems of Earth, as well as to extraterrestrial ecosystems. These ecosystems are sustained by chemical energy obtained from inorganic redox substances (e.g., H2S, CO2, H2, CH4, and O2) in hydrothermal fluids and ambient seawater. The chemical and isotope compositions of the hydrothermal fluid are, in turn, controlled by subseafloor physical and chemical processes, including fluid‚Äìrock interactions, phase separation and partitioning of fluids, and precipitation of minerals. We hypothesized that specific physicochemical principles describe the linkages among the living ecosystems, hydrothermal fluids, and geological background in deep-sea hydrothermal systems. We estimated the metabolic energy potentially available for productivity by chemolithotrophic microorganisms at various hydrothermal vent fields. We used a geochemical model based on hydrothermal fluid chemistry data compiled from 89 globally distributed hydrothermal vent sites. The model estimates were compared to the observed variability in extant microbial communities in seafloor hydrothermal environments. Our calculations clearly show that representative chemolithotrophic metabolisms (e.g., thiotrophic, hydrogenotrophic, and methanotrophic) respond differently to geological and geochemical variations in the hydrothermal systems. Nearly all of the deep-sea hydrothermal systems provide abundant energy for organisms with aerobic thiotrophic metabolisms; observed variations in the H2S concentrations among the hydrothermal fluids had little effect on the energetics of thiotrophic metabolism. Thus, these organisms form the base of the chemosynthetic microbial community in global deep-sea hydrothermal environments. In contrast, variations in H2 concentrations in hydrothermal fluids significantly impact organisms with aerobic and anaerobic hydrogenotrophic metabolisms. Particularly in H2-rich ultramafic rock-hosted hydrothermal systems, anaerobic and aerobic hydrogenotrophy is more energetically significant than thiotrophy. The CH4 concentration also has a considerable impact on organisms with aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophic metabolisms, particularly in sediment-associated hydrothermal systems. Recently clarified patterns and functions of existing microbial communities and their metabolisms are generally consistent with the results of our thermodynamic modeling of the hydrothermal mixing zones. These relationships provide important directions for future research addressing the origin and early evolution of life on Earth as well as for the search for extraterrestrial life.},

	abstract = {Urbanization along coastlines alters marine ecosystems including contributing molecules of anthropogenic origin to the coastal dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool. A broad assessment of the nature and extent of anthropogenic impacts on coastal ecosystems is urgently needed to inform regulatory guidelines and ecosystem management. Recently, non-targeted tandem mass spectrometry approaches are gaining momentum for the analysis of global organic matter composition (chemotypes) including a wide array of natural and anthropogenic compounds. In line with these efforts, we developed a non-targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) workflow that utilizes advanced data analysis approaches such as feature-based molecular networking and repository-scale spectrum searches. This workflow allows the scalable comparison and mapping of seawater chemotypes from large-scale spatial surveys as well as molecular family level annotation of unknown compounds. As a case study, we visualized organic matter chemotype shifts in coastal environments in northern San Diego, USA, after notable rain fall in winter 2017/2018 and highlight potential anthropogenic impacts. The observed seawater chemotype, consisting of 4384 LC-MS/MS features, shifted significantly after a major rain event. Molecular drivers of this shift could be attributed to multiple anthropogenic compounds, including pesticides (Imazapyr and Isoxaben), cleaning products (Benzyl-tetradecyl-dimethylammonium) and chemical additives (Hexa (methoxymethyl)melamine) and potential degradation products. By expanding the search of identified xenobiotics to other public tandem mass spectrometry datasets, we further contextualized their possible origin and show their importance in other ecosystems. The mass spectrometry and data analysis pipelines applied here offer a scalable framework for future molecular mapping and monitoring of marine ecosystems, which will contribute to a deliberate assessment of how chemical pollution impacts our oceans.},

Once in the ocean, this DOM is transported together with elements, particles, dissolved gases, and biomass along with the neutrally buoyant plume layer. Considering the number and extent of actively venting hydrothermal sites in the oceans, their contribution to the oceanic DOM pool may be substantial. Here, we investigate the dynamics of DOM in relation to hydrothermal venting and related processes at the as-yet unexplored Aurora hydrothermal vent field within the ultraslow spreading Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean at 82.9\&deg; N. We examined the vertical distribution of DOM composition from sea ice to deep waters at six hydrocast stations distal to the active vent and its neutrally buoyant plume layer. In comparison to background seawater, we found that the DOM in waters directly affected by the hydrothermal plume was composed of lower numbers of molecular formulas and 5\&ndash;10 \% less abundant compositions associated with the molecular categories related to lipid and protein-like compounds. Samples that were not directly affected by the plume, on the other hand, were chemically more diverse and had a higher percentage of chemical formulas associated with the carbohydrate-like category. We suggest, therefore, that hydrothermal processes at Aurora may influence the DOM distribution in the bathypelagic ocean by spreading more thermally and/or chemically induced compositions, while DOM compositions in epipelagic and mesopelagic layers are mainly governed by the microbial carbon pump dynamics, and sea ice surface water interactions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Arctic Ocean receives a large supply of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from its catchment and shelf sediments, which can be traced across much of the basin's upper waters. This signature can potentially be used as a tracer. On the shelf, the combination of river discharge and sea-ice formation, modifies water densities and mixing considerably. These waters are a source of the halocline layer that covers much of the Arctic Ocean, but also contain elevated levels of DOM. Here we demonstrate how this can be used as a supplementary tracer and contribute to evaluating ocean circulation in the Arctic. A fraction of the organic compounds that DOM consists of fluoresce and can be measured using in-situ fluorometers. When deployed on autonomous platforms these provide high temporal and spatial resolution measurements over long periods. The results of an analysis of data derived from several Ice Tethered Profilers (ITPs) offer a unique spatial coverage of the distribution of DOM in the surface 800 m below Arctic sea-ice. Water mass analysis using temperature, salinity and DOM fluorescence, can clearly distinguish between the contribution of Siberian terrestrial DOM and marine DOM from the Chukchi shelf to the waters of the halocline. The findings offer a new approach to trace the distribution of Pacific waters and its export from the Arctic Ocean. Our results indicate the potential to extend the approach to separate freshwater contributions from, sea-ice melt, riverine discharge and the Pacific Ocean.},

	abstract = {Particulate organic matter (POM) in coastal systems is a mixture of different organic matter (OM) sources originating from land and sea. Among sources, bacterial biomass plays a large role in OM processing and carbon recycling in the ocean and is often neglected as a source in common approaches. The present study proposes to use elemental and isotopic ratio of carbon and nitrogen (C:N, Œ¥13C, Œ¥15N) and fatty acids to investigate the relationship between bacteria and surface water POM composition of three systems with different characteristics (two marine and one estuarine) over an annual cycle. Overall, our results highlight a positive relationship be¬≠ tween bacterial contribution and continental degraded or undergoing degradation POM for all the studied sys¬≠ tems and an inverse relationship with pelagic primary producers. At multisystem scale, high bacterial contribution is linked to high proportion of refractory terrestrial material characterizing estuarine stations whereas in marine systems, the occurrence of bacteria is mainly linked to river POM. Over the annual cycle, bacterial markers are more abundant during the winter period characterized by larger river and/or benthic POM contribution. This seasonal pattern is mainly driven by changes in river flows and resuspension. This study highlights the importance of bacterial compartment as a component of coastal and estuarine POM. Even though these results remains semi-quantitative, similar studies in other types of systems can help to understand mi¬≠ crobial role in OM dynamic and to better estimate bacterial source in carbon budgets and food web studies.},

	abstract = {Vestfjorden in northern Norway, a major spawning ground for the northeast Arctic cod, is sheltered from the continental shelf and open ocean by the Lofoten‚ÄìVester√•len archipelago. The archipelago, however, is well known for hosting strong and vigorous tidal currents in its many straits, currents that can produce signiÔ¨Åcant time-mean tracer transport from Vestfjorden to the shelf outside. We use a purely tidally driven unstructured-grid ocean model to look into non-linear tidal dynamics and the associated tracer transport through the archipelago. Of particular interest are two processes: tidal pumping through the straits and tidal rectiÔ¨Åcation around islands. The most prominent tracer transport is caused by tidal pumping through the short and strongly non-linear straits NordlandsÔ¨Çaget and Moskstraumen near the southern tip of the archipelago. Here, tracers from Vestfjorden are transported tens of kilometers westward out on the outer shelf. Further north, weaker yet notable tidal pumping also takes place through the longer straits Nappstraumen and Gims√∏ystraumen. The other main transport route out of Vestfjorden is south of the island of R√∏st. Here, the transport is primarily due to tracer advection by rectiÔ¨Åed anticyclonic currents around the island. There is also an anticyclonic circulation cell around the island group Mosken‚ÄìV√¶r√∏y, and both cells have Ô¨Çow speeds up to 0.2 m s‚àí1, magnitudes similar to the observed background currents in the region. These high-resolution simulations thus emphasize the importance of non-linear tidal dynamics for transport of Ô¨Çoating particles, like cod eggs and larvae, in the region.},

Two MiniFluos can be installed on a glider, each equipped with two optical channels (one PAH is measured per channel). This setup allows the measurement of up to 4 different fluorescent PAHs: Naphthalene, Phenanthrene, Fluorene and Pyrene. Laboratory tests on oil products (Maya crude oil and Diesel fuel) as well as on marine samples near industrial areas (urban harbor and offshore installations) revealed that the concentration of the four PAHs targeted accounted for 62‚Äì97\% of the total PAH concentration found in samples (‚àë16 PAHs determined by standard international protocols). Laboratory tests also revealed that for marine applications, the calibration on Water Accommodated Fraction (WAF) of crude oil is more appropriate than the one on pure standards (STD). This is because PAH fluorescence is constituted in large part of alkylated compounds that are not considered with STD calibration. Results from three glider deployments with increasing levels of complexity (a laboratory trial, a field mission in non-autonomous mode and a fully autonomous mission) are also presented. During field deployments, the MiniFluo-glider package was able to detect concentration gradients from offshore marine waters toward the head of a Mediterranean harbor ({\textless} 80 ng L‚àí1) as well as hydrocarbon patches at the surface waters of an oil and gas exploitation field in the North Sea ({\textless} 200 ng L‚àí1, mainly Naphthalene). It is suggested that using only the WAF calibration, the concentration derived with the MiniFluo agrees within one order of magnitude with the concentration determined by Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (overestimation by a factor 7 on average). These performances can be improved if the calibration is made with a WAF with PAH proportions similar to the one find in the environment. Finally, it is shown that the use of in situ calibration on water samples collected during the glider deployment, when possible, gives the best results.},

            Microbial activity mediates the fluxes of greenhouse gases. However, in the global models of the marine and terrestrial biospheres used for climate change projections, typically only photosynthetic microbial activity is resolved mechanistically. To move forward, we argue that global biogeochemical models need a theoretically grounded framework with which to constrain parameterizations of diverse microbial metabolisms. Here, we explain how the key redox chemistry underlying metabolisms provides a path towards this goal. Using this first-principles approach, the presence or absence of metabolic functional types emerges dynamically from ecological interactions, expanding model applicability to unobserved environments.

	abstract = {The detailed investigation of microbial communities, e.g. of soil or hydrothermal vent ecosystems, greatly improved our understanding of the diversity, habitat preferences and functions of microorganisms and their impact on global element cycles. The aim of this thesis was a detailed analysis of the diversity, abundance and distribution of micoorganisms at marine methane seeps and the mechanisms that govern community assembly at these sites. The seep ecosystems were investigated using geochemical analyses, gene libraries, pyrosequencing, community fingerprinting and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Cold seep ecosystems hosted distinct microbial communities that differed from those of the surrounding seabed and were unique microbial habitat patches in the deep sea. The communities also greatly differed between seeps, covered broad ranges of richness and evenness and showed high degrees of endemism. However, despite the differences all seeps were inhabited by certain organisms   the cold seep microbiome - including key functional clades of anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Additionally, aerobic methanotrophs and thiotrophs were found at all seeps where oxygen was present. These key functional clades seemed to be influenced by environmental parameters, such as temperature, fluid flux, sediment depth and faunal activity. Bioirrigation by ampharetid tubeworms, for instance, created a habitat for aerobic Methylococcales, whereas vesicomyid clams seemed to favor the establishment of the clade ANME-2c. Thus, niche-based processes played an important role for the community assembly at seep ecosystems. However, most of the seeps seemed to be clearly dominated by a few, globally distributed operational taxonomic units at 97\% 16S rRNA gene identity (OTU0.03) of each key functional clade. Some of these OTU0.03 were rare at some seep ecosystems and abundant at others. Moreover, some findings suggested that rare organisms became abundant because the environmental conditions at the seep changed supporting the importance of species sorting at seep communities. Finally, the succession of microbial communities and the emergence of ecosystem function at a cold seep were monitored showing that it may take years to develop fully functioning communities that efficiently remove the potential greenhouse gas methane. Overall this work may help to resolve the mysteries of microbial community ecology at cold seep ecosystems.},

	abstract = {There is a need for an inexpensive, reliable and fast monitoring tool to detect contaminants in a short time, for quick mitigation of pollution sources and site remediation, and for characterization of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM). Fluorescence spectroscopy has proven to be an excellent technique in quantifying aquatic DOM, from autochthonous, allochthonous or anthropogenic sources. This paper reviews the advances in in situ fluorescence measurements of DOM and pollutants in various water environments. Studies have demonstrated, using high temporal-frequency DOM fluorescence data, that marine autochthonous production of DOM is highly complex and that the allochthonous input of DOM from freshwater to marine water can be predicted. Furthermore, river measurement studies found a delayed fluorescence response of DOM following precipitation compared to turbidity and discharge, with various lags, depending on season, site and input of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. In addition, research has shown that blue light fluorescence (Œªemission‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ430‚Äì500‚ÄØnm) can be a good proxy for DOC, in environments with terrestrial inputs, and ultraviolet fluorescence (Œªemission‚ÄØ=‚ÄØUVA‚Äì320‚Äì400‚ÄØnm) for biochemical oxygen demand, and also E. coli in environments with sanitation issues. The correction of raw fluorescence data improves the relationship between fluorescence intensity and these parameters. This review also presents the specific steps and parameters that must be considered before and during in situ fluorescence measurement session for a harmonized qualitative and quantitative protocol. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of the research on in situ fluorescence are identified.},

	abstract = {Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in the Mediterranean Sea was analysed by excitation‚Äìemission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy and parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis during the cruise HOTMIX 2014. A 4‚Äìcomponent model, including 3 humic‚Äìlike and 1 protein‚Äìlike compounds, was obtained. To decipher the environmental factors that dictate the distributions of these components, we run generalized additive models (GAMs) in the epipelagic layer and an optimum multiparametric (OMP) water masses analysis in the meso‚Äì and bathypelagic layers. In the epipelagic layer, apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) and temperature presented the most significant effects on the variability of the marine humic-like peak M fluorescence, suggesting that its distribution was controlled by the net community respiration of organic matter and photobleaching. On the contrary, the variability of the soil humic-like peak E and the protein‚Äìlike peak T fluorescence was explained mainly by the prokaryotic heterotrophic abundance, which decreased eastwards. In the meso‚Äì and bathypelagic layers, water mass mixing and basin‚Äìscale mineralization processes explained {\textgreater}72\% and 63\% of the humic‚Äìlike and protein‚Äìlike fluorescence variability, respectively. When analysing the two basins separately, the OMP model offered a better explanation of the distribution of fluorescence in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, as expected from the reduced biological activity in this ultra‚Äìoligotrophic basin. Furthermore, while western Mediterranean deep waters display the usual trend in the global ocean (increase of humic‚Äìlike fluorescence and decrease of protein‚Äìlike fluorescence with higher AOU values), the eastern Mediterranean deep waters presented an opposite trend. Different initial fluorescence intensities of the water masses that mix in the eastern basin, with Adriatic and Aegean origins, seem to be behind this contrasting pattern. The analysis of the transect‚Äìscale mineralization processes corroborate this hypothesis, suggesting a production of humic‚Äìlike and a consumption of protein‚Äìlike fluorescence in parallel with water mass ageing. Remarkably, the transect‚Äìscale variability of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorbing at the excitation wavelength of the humic‚Äìlike peak M indicates an unexpected loss with increasing AOU, which suggests that the consumption of the non‚Äìfluorescent fraction of CDOM absorbing at that wavelength exceeded the production of the fluorescent fraction observed here.},

The latter is frequently utilized in laboratory measurements of its dissolved fraction (fluorescent dissolved organic matter, FDOM) through excitation‚Äìemission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS). We present the design and field application of a novel EEMS sensor system applicable in situ, the ‚ÄòKallemeter‚Äô. Observations are based on a field campaign, starting in Norwegian coastal waters entering the Trondheimsfjord. Comparison against the bulk fluorescence of two commercial FDOM sensors exhibited a good correspondence of the different methods and the ability to resolve gradients and dynamics along the transect. Complementary laboratory EEM spectra measurements of surface water samples and their subsequent PARAFAC analysis revealed three dominant components while the ‚ÄòKallemeter‚Äô EEMS sensor system was able to produce reasonable EEM spectra in high DOM concentrated water bodies, yet high noise levels must be addressed in order to provide comparable PARAFAC components. Achievements and limitations of this proof-of-concept are discussed providing guidance towards full in situ EEMS measurements to resolve rapid changes and processes in natural waters based on the assessment of spectral properties. Their combination with multiwavelength FDOM sensors onboard autonomous platforms will enhance our capacities in observing biogeochemical processes in the marine environment in spatiotemporal and spectral dimensions.},

It remains elusive how these hotspots of biodiversity can thrive in such a food-limited environment, as data on energy flow and organic carbon utilization are critically lacking. Here we report in situ community respiration rates for cold-water coral and sponge ecosystems obtained by the non-invasive aquatic Eddy Correlation technique. Oxygen uptake rates over coral reefs and adjacent sponge grounds in the Tr√¶na Coral Field (Norway) were 9‚Äì20 times higher than those of the surrounding soft sediments. These high respiration rates indicate strong organic matter consumption, and hence suggest a local focusing onto these ecosystems of the downward flux of organic matter that is exported from the surface ocean. Overall, our results show that coral reefs and adjacent sponge grounds are hotspots of carbon processing in the food-limited deep ocean, and that these deep-sea ecosystems play a more prominent role in marine biogeochemical cycles than previously recognized.},

Furthermore a decrease in Mg content at the two highest CO2 treatments was observed. Comparison between our data and that at 3 months from the same long-term experiment shows that the acclimation differs over time since at 3 months, the samples cultured under high pCO2 showed a reduction in the cell (inter and intra) wall thickness but a maintained growth rate. This suggests a reallocation of the energy budget between 3 and 10 months and highlights the high degree plasticity that is present.

Still, our knowledge of the likely effects of climate change and ocean acidiÔ¨Åcation on key species in the food web, functionally important habitats and the structure of Arctic and sub-Arctic ecosystems is limited and based mainly on short-term laboratory studies on single species. This review discusses how tropical and temperate natural analogues of carbonate chemistry drivers, such as CO2 vents, have been used to further our knowledge of the sensitivity of biological systems to predicted climate change, and thus assess the capacity of different species to show long-term acclimation and adaptation to elevated levels of pCO2. Natural analogues have also provided the means to scale-up from single-species responses to community and ecosystem level responses. However, to date the application of such approaches is limited in high latitude systems. A range of Arctic and sub-Arctic sites, including CO2 vents, methane cold seeps, estuaries, up-welling areas, and polar fronts, that encompass gradients of pH, carbonate saturation state, and alkalinity, are suggested for future high latitude, in-situ ocean acidiÔ¨Åcation research. It is recommended that combinations of monitoring of the chemical oceanography, observational, and experimental (in situ and laboratory) studies of organisms around these natural analogues be used to attain better predictions of the impacts of ocean acidiÔ¨Åcation and climate change on high latitude species and ecosystems.},

Sulphidic bottom water likely prevents colonization by cnidarians and sponges, resulting in fewer taxa than deeper seeps in the region, representing a deviation from depth-related trends seen among seeps elsewhere. O. haakonmosbiensis was present among carbonate and barite crusts, constituting the first record of frenulates among hard substrates. The presence of both adults and egg cases indicate that Ambylraja hyperborea skates use the site as an egg case nursery ground. Due to sub-zero ambient temperatures (‚àí0.7‚Äâ¬∞C), we hypothesize that small, seepage related heat anomalies aid egg incubation and prevent embryo mortality.

	abstract = {The boron isotope systematics has been determined for azooxanthellate scleractinian corals from a wide range of both deep-sea and shallow-water environments. The aragonitic coral species, Caryophyllia smithii, Desmophyllum dianthus, Enallopsammia rostrata, Lophelia pertusa, and Madrepora oculata, are all found to have relatively high Œ¥11B compositions ranging from 23.2‚Ä∞ to 28.7‚Ä∞. These values lie substantially above the pH-dependent inorganic seawater borate equilibrium curve, indicative of strong up-regulation of pH of the internal calcifying fluid (pHcf), being elevated by ‚àº0.6‚Äì0.8units (ŒîpH) relative to ambient seawater. In contrast, the deep-sea calcitic coral Corallium sp. has a significantly lower Œ¥11B composition of 15.5‚Ä∞, with a corresponding lower ŒîpH value of ‚àº0.3units, reflecting the importance of mineralogical control on biological pH up-regulation. The solitary coral D. dianthus was sampled over a wide range of seawater pHT and shows an approximate linear correlation with ŒîpHDesmo=6.43‚àí0.71pHT (r2=0.79). An improved correlation is however found with the closely related parameter of seawater aragonite saturation state, where ŒîpHDesmo=1.09‚àí0.14Œ©arag (r2=0.95), indicating the important control that carbonate saturation state has on calcification. The ability to up-regulate internal pHcf, and consequently Œ©cf, of the calcifying fluid is therefore a process present in both azooxanthellate and zooxanthellate aragonitic corals, and is attributed to the action of Ca2+-ATPase in modulating the proton gradient between seawater and the site of calcification. These findings also show that the boron isotopic compositions (Œ¥11Bcarb) of aragonitic corals are highly systematic and consistent with direct uptake of the borate species within the biologically controlled extracellular calcifying medium. We also show that the relatively strong up-regulation of pH and consequent elevation of the internal carbonate saturation state (Œ©cf ‚àº8.5 to ‚àº13) at the site of calcification by cold-water corals, facilitates calcification at or in some cases below the aragonite saturation horizon, providing a greater ability to adapt to the already low and now decreasing carbonate ion concentrations. Although providing greater resilience to the effects of ocean acidification and enhancing rates of calcification with increasing temperature, the process of internal pHcf up-regulation has an associated energetic cost, and therefore growth-rate cost, of ‚àº10\% per 0.1 pH unit decrease in seawater pHT. Furthermore, as the aragonite saturation horizon shoals with rapidly increasing pCO2 and Œ©arag{\textless}1, increased dissolution of the exposed skeleton will ultimately limit their survival in the deep oceans.},

	abstract = {A previous analysis of published data suggested that annual, pelagic primary production in the Arctic Ocean is related linearly to the duration of the ice-free period, presumably through cumulative exposure to solar irradiance. However, the regions with the longest ice-free periods are located in peripheral seas and polynyas where nutrient supply by advection or the vertical mixing induced by winds and convection can be extensive. The ensuing replenishment of nutrients drives primary production to levels unattained in the strongly stratified interior (e.g. the Beaufort Sea), with the exception of upwelling areas. A reanalysis of published data showed no relation between cumulative production and incident solar radiation during the growth season. We propose that changes in annual primary production per unit area in seasonally ice-free waters are controlled primarily by the environmental forcing of nitrogen supply. Incidental changes in light regime should mostly affect the timing and, possibly, the species composition of the main production pulse(s) in the upper mixed layer and, underneath, the ability of phytoplankton to exploit nutrients in the lower euphotic zone. While the ongoing rise in the supply of heat and freshwater to the Arctic Ocean should bolster vertical stratification and further impede the mean upward supply of nutrients, episodic yet direct atmospheric forcing of the upper ocean may act in synergy with a prolonged exposure to light and greatly augment pelagic productivity.},

	abstract = {Rationale Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) is a preferred technique for analyzing complex organic mixtures. Currently, there is no consensus normalization approach, nor an objective method for selecting one, for quantitative analyses of FT-ICR-MS data. We investigate a method to evaluate and score the amount of bias various normalization approaches introduce into the data. Methods We evaluate the ability of the Statistical Procedure for the Analysis of Normalization Strategies (SPANS) to guide the selection of appropriate normalization approaches for two different FT-ICR-MS data sets. Furthermore, we test the robustness of SPANS results to changes in SPANS parameter values and assess the impact of using various normalization approaches on downstream statistical analyses. Results The normalization approach identified by SPANS differed for the two data sets. Normalization methods impacted the statistical significance of peaks differently, underscoring the importance of carefully evaluating potential methods. More consistent SPANS scores resulted when at least 120 significant peaks are used, where larger sets of peaks were obtained by increasing the p-value threshold. Interestingly, we show that total sum scaling and highest peak normalization, used in previous studies, underperformed relative to SPANS-recommended normalization approaches. Conclusions Although there is no single, best normalization method for all data sets, SPANS provides a mechanism to identify an appropriate normalization method for analyzing FT-ICR-MS data quantitatively. The number of peaks used in the background distributions of SPANS contributes more significantly to the reproducibility of results than the p-value thresholds used to obtain those peaks.},

Such accumulation will allow export of DOC to the aphotic zone by diffusion and downwelling. As an alternative to models based on low degradability, we here propose a mechanism where bacterial carbon consumption is restricted due to food web mechanisms controlling both growth and biomass of the bacteria: growth rate is kept low by bacteria-phytoplankton competition for mineral nutrients, and biomass is kept low by bacterial predators. With such a mechanism, otherwise degradable material may accumulate and become subject both to chemical transformation and vertical transport. The steady-states of a model describing the interactions between heterotrophic bacteria, phytoplankton, and bacterivorous protozoa is used to explore how the balance between DOC production and consumption shifts along a gradient from oligotrophy to eutrophy.},

	abstract = {Primary productivity in the Arctic Ocean is experiencing dramatic changes linked to the receding sea ice cover. The vertical transport of nutrients from deeper water layers is the limiting factor for primary production. Here, we compare coincident profiles of turbulence and nutrients from the Siberian Seas in 2007, 2008 and 2018. In all years, the water column structure in the upstream region of the Arctic Boundary Current promotes upward nutrient transport, in contrast to the regions further downstream, and there are first indications for an eastward progression of these conditions. In summer 2018, strongly enhanced vertical nitrate flux and primary production above the continental slope were observed, likely related to a remote storm. The estimated contribution of these elevated fluxes above the slope to the Pan-Arctic vertical nitrate supply is comparable with the basin-wide transport, and is predicted to increase with declining sea ice cover in the future.},

We combined high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS) for the structural and molecular formula-level characterization of solid-phase extracted (SPE) DOM from surface, mesopelagic, and bathypelagic Atlantic and Pacific Ocean samples. Using a MicroCryoProbe, unprecedented low amounts of SPE-DOM (‚àº1 mg carbon) were sufficient for two-dimensional NMR analysis. Low proportions of olefinic and aromatic relative to aliphatic and carboxylated structures (NMR) at the sea surface were likely related to photochemical transformations. This was consistent with lower molecular masses and higher degrees of saturation and oxygenation (FT-ICR-MS) compared to those of the deep sea. Carbohydrate structures in the mesopelagic North Pacific Ocean suggest export and release from sinking particles. In our sample set, the universal molecular DOM composition, as captured by FT-ICR-MS, appears to be structurally more diverse when analyzed by NMR, suggesting DOM variability across oceanic provinces to be more pronounced than previously assumed. As a proof of concept, our study takes advantage of new complementary approaches resolving thousands of structural and molecular DOM features while applying reasonable instrument times, allowing for the analysis of large oceanic data sets to increase our understanding of marine DOM biogeochemistry.},

We present unique 10- and 3-month time series of bottom water measurements of physical and chemical parameters from two autonomous ocean observatories deployed at separate intense seabed methane seep sites (91 and 246 m depth) offshore western Svalbard from 2015 to 2016.

Rapid variability is explained by uneven distribution of seepage and changing ocean current directions. No overt influence of tidal hydrostatic pressure or water temperature variations on methane concentration was observed, but an observed negative correlation with temperature at the 246 m site fits with hypothesized seasonal blocking of lateral methane pathways in the sediments. Negative correlation between bottom water methane concentration (and variability) and wind forcing, concomitant with signs of weaker water column stratification, indicates increased potential for methane release to the atmosphere in fall and winter. We present new information about short- and long-term methane variability and provide a preliminary constraint on the uncertainties that arise in methane inventory estimates from this variability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding how the earth system interacts with ongoing climate change is important to find a realistic route towards a sustainable future. The impact of Arctic seabed methane seepage on contemporary and future climate is still poorly constrained, described, and quantified. An important limiting factor in our understanding of seabed seepage in the Arctic is a lack of in situ measurements; however, remoteness and harsh environmental conditions make data acquisition difficult. The aim of this thesis is to improve understanding of and ability to measure methane in the Arctic Ocean via inter-disciplinary work, method development and time-series analysis. 
{\textless}p{\textgreater}To fill crucial data gaps and increase the general data coverage in the region demands implementation of innovative technology and increased research activity. Legal scholars have identified emerging legal gaps associated with this increased activity and regulation of marine scientific research. However, our inter-disciplinary assessment indicates that an evolutionary interpretation of the legal framework is currently adequate to regulate and facilitate current conduct of marine scientific research in the Arctic Ocean. 
{\textless}p{\textgreater}We obtained a unique data set from two intense seep sites (at 91 and 246 meter depth) offshore West Spitsbergen by deploying two autonomous ocean observatories which recorded respectively 10 and 3 month time-series of bottom water physical and chemical parameters between July 2015 and May 2016. High short term variability ({\textless}‚àº1000 nmol L$^{\textrm{‚àí1}}$ on hourly time-scales) were observed which were partly explained by changing ocean currents and location of nearby seeps. A seasonal variation with lower (‚àºhalved) concentrations and variability in winter season was coupled with increased water column 
mixing. No clear effect of tidal hydrostatic pressure changes were observed, but a negative correlation between methane and temperature at the deepest seep site aligns well with hypothesized seasonal blocking of lateral sedimentary methane pathways. We highlighted and quantified potential uncertainties that can arise from high short-term variability in budget estimates. 
{\textless}p{\textgreater}To enable direct observations of bubble release, we developed a method for using ADCP to monitor seabed seepage. The method makes it possible to integrate all backscatter data from the ADCP and monitor seepage activity on the seafloor by modeling bubble transport in the water column. Using this model, the ADCP at the 91 meter observatory uncovered continuous ongoing seepage to the north of the observatory and a stationary seep configuration.  
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Several chemical sensors, including conventional dissolved methane sensors, rely on separating the medium of interest (e.g. methane) from the measured medium (e.g. water) using equilibrium partitioning across a membrane. This process causes slow response times, which is problematic for applications where steep gradients are expected such as at our observatory location, in profiling or other highly dynamic domains. We developed a new technique to deconvolve slow response signals and obtain fast response data by using the theoretical framework of statistical inverse theory. This method provides an explicit uncertainty estimate, quality assessment of the result and no extra input parameters other than what already provided in standard calibration procedures. 
{\textless}p{\textgreater}There is a vast range of questions that are relevant to pursue to increase our understanding of seabed methane seepage in the Arctic Ocean. In light and line of this work, future efforts to improve quantification of methane and methane seepage could focus on assessing uncertainty in various approaches to budget estimates, further validate new methodology presented herein and use these on e.g. autonomous vehicles capable of providing large volumes of high resolution data within short time spans.},

In this study, DOM in process water during advanced drinking water treatment was fractionated sequentially by three solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges based on the polarity and charge of DOM molecules. By sequential SPE with unknown screening analysis, over 3000 DOM features were found in raw water, whereas around 2000 were obtained by a single SPE. The hydrophobic neutral (HPON) fraction contained CHO features with highest averaged molecular weight followed by hydrophobic acid (HPOA) and then hydrophilic acid (HPIA). The average degree of carbon double bond equivalents and carbon oxidation states indicated that the HPON fraction contained molecules that were more unsaturated and less oxidized than those of the HPOA and HPIA fractions. Ozone selectively decomposed (1) more unsaturated and less oxidized HPON features, (2) more unsaturated HPOA compounds, and (3) less oxidized HPIA molecules. Oxidation by-products were mostly HPON and HPIA compounds that were more oxidized than the decomposed molecules. During biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration, less oxidized HPON were preferentially removed, whereas HPOA were removed without selectivity. HPON and HPIA molecules with more oxidized character were found to be refractory to BAC treatment. HPON with more unsaturated and HPIA with more oxidized characters were decomposed by chlorine. Many types of HPIA decomposed during chlorination were the oxidation by-products of ozonation that were refractory to BAC treatment. Sequential SPE with unknown screening analysis provided previously unknown details of the molecular characteristics of DOM and its changes during advanced water treatment.},

The origins and yields of biomarkers were determined in cultured marine bacteria, and the results indicated that D-amino acids are derived from numerous macromolecules in addition to peptidoglycan and are not solely from peptidoglycan. Bacterial detritus was a major component of particulate organic matter (POM) and is an important source of submicronsize particles and colloids in the ocean. Peptidoglycan was a substantial component of POM but not of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Compositional differences between POM and DOM primarily reflected the selective incorporation of specific bacterial components into these reservoirs. Autotrophic and heterotrophic bacterial sources were not quantified separately, but the presence of D-aspartic acid (D-Asx) and D-serine (D-Ser) suggested that heterotrophic sources were substantial. The average reactivity of bacterial organic matter was comparable to that of the bulk organic carbon pool. Bacteria were important sources of labile, semilabile, and refractory dissolved organic carbon. Bacterial organic matter accounted for 25\% of particulate and dissolved organic carbon and 50\% of particulate and dissolved organic nitrogen. These results demonstrate the importance of bacteria in regulating the ocean carbon and nitrogen cycles.},

	abstract = {Oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an assemblage of reduced carbon compounds, which results from biotic and abiotic processes. The biotic processes consist in either release or uptake of specific molecules by marine organisms. Heterotrophic bacteria have been mostly considered to influence the DOM composition by preferential uptake of certain compounds. However, they also secrete a variety of molecules depending on physiological state, environmental and growth conditions, but so far the full set of compounds secreted by these bacteria has never been investigated. In this study, we analyzed the exo-metabolome, metabolites secreted into the environment, of the heterotrophic marine bacterium Pseudovibrio sp. FO-BEG1 via ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry, comparing phosphate limited with phosphate surplus growth conditions. Bacteria belonging to the Pseudovibrio genus have been isolated worldwide, mainly from marine invertebrates and were described as metabolically versatile Alphaproteobacteria. We show that the exo-metabolome is unexpectedly large and diverse, consisting of hundreds of compounds that differ by their molecular formulae. It is characterized by a dynamic recycling of molecules, and it is drastically affected by the physiological state of the strain. Moreover, we show that phosphate limitation greatly influences both the amount and the composition of the secreted molecules. By assigning the detected masses to general chemical categories, we observed that under phosphate surplus conditions the secreted molecules were mainly peptides and highly unsaturated compounds. In contrast, under phosphate limitation the composition of the exo-metabolome changed during bacterial growth, showing an increase in highly unsaturated, phenolic, and polyphenolic compounds. Finally, we annotated the detected masses using multiple metabolite databases. These analyses suggested the presence of several masses analogue to masses of known bioactive compounds. However, the annotation was successful only for a minor part of the detected molecules, underlining the current gap in knowledge concerning the biosynthetic ability of marine heterotrophic bacteria.},

The instrument was designed around custom vacuum chambers for improved ion optical alignment, minimized distance from the external ion trap to magnetic field center, and high conductance for effective differential pumping. The length of the transfer optics is 30\% shorter than the prior system, for reduced time-of-flight mass discrimination and increased ion transmission and trapping efficiency at the ICR cell. The ICR cell, electrical vacuum feedthroughs, and cabling have been improved to reduce the detection circuit capacitance (and improve detection sensitivity) 2-fold.

	abstract = {Ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry is widely used for nontargeted analysis of complex environmental and biological mixtures, such as dissolved organic matter, due to its unparalleled ability to provide accurate mass measurements. Accurate and efficient characterization of these mixtures is critical to being better able to evaluate their effect on human health and climate. This characterization requires accurate mass signals free from isobaric interferences, instrument noise, and mass measurement biases, allowing for molecular formula identification. To address this need, an open source post-processing pipeline for ultrahigh resolution mass spectra of environmental complex mixtures software was developed. MFAssignR contains functions that perform noise estimation, 13C and 34S polyisotopic mass filtering, mass measurement recalibration, and molecular formula assignment as part of a consistent data processing environment. Novel applications of mass defect analysis were used in the functions for noise estimation and isotope pair identification. Using formula extensions, exact mass measurements are converted to unambiguous molecular formulas via data dependent pathways, reducing a priori decisions. Optional molecular formula ambiguity and multiple non-oxygen heteroatoms are provided for custom user applications, including isotopically labeled reactive species, halogen-containing species, or tandem ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. This represents uncommon flexibility for an open-source software package. To evaluate the performance of MFAssignR, it was used to characterize a sample of biomass burning influenced organic aerosol and the results were compared to those from other available methods of molecular formula assignment and noise estimation. The differences between the methods are described here. Overall, the inclusion of a full pipeline of data preparation functions and the data-dependent ambiguity reductions in MFAssignR render excellent results and make MFAssignR well-suited for the consistent and efficient analysis of environmental complex mixtures.

Using a camera placed at a fixed position, particle motions can be visualized by rendering trajectories or by animations. Applying such direct techniques to large, time dependent particle data sets often results in cluttered images in which the dynamic properties of the underlying system are difficult to interpret. In this case study we take an alternative approach to the visualization of ion motions. Instead of rendering ion position data directly, we first extract meaningful motion information from the ion position data and then map this information onto geometric primitives. Our goal is to produce high-level visualizations that reflect the physicists' way of thinking about ion dynamics. Parameterized geometric icons are defined to encode motion information of clusters of related ions. In addition, a parameterized camera control mechanism is used to analyze relative instead of only absolute ion motions. We apply the techniques to simulations of Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) experiments. The data produced by such simulations can amount to 5.104 ions and 105 timesteps.

	abstract = {Here, we present the Predator data station, a control system for FT-ICR mass spectrometers that champions speed and experimental flexibility while simultaneously providing stability, ease of use, and the ability to integrate more advanced hardware as it becomes available. The Predator is the first FT-ICR MS data station comprised solely of fast PCI, PXI, and yet faster PXI Express-based commercial data acquisition hardware. Increased data transfer speed is required because recorded transient data count increases linearly at higher magnetic field (higher measured frequency) with extended transient duration for FT-ICR MS instruments. The application of new cell designs with additional compensation voltages, experimental techniques to increase resolution, and experimental techniques that minimize/reject variations in ion abundance exemplify the scope of recent Predator data station implementations. When the above techniques are applied simultaneously, the results give rise to sub-30ppb rms mass error for 5250 assigned peaks in a petroleum FT-ICR mass spectrum. The Predator data station is designed for facile implementation with any FT-ICR MS instrument. The Predator hardware provides 17 analog voltage outputs and 18 digital TTL outputs synchronized to a single timing source. SWIFT, chirp, and single frequency excitation waveforms are generated by a 100MSample/s arbitrary waveform generator with a minimum 32MB of onboard memory and the potential of terabytes of virtual memory via first in-first out (FIFO) buffering. Transient detection is facilitated by a 2-channel, 100MSample/s digitizer with a minimum of 32MB of onboard memory per channel. FIFO buffering implementation allows TB transient collection as well. Commercial hardware, royalty-free software solutions, and commercially produced custom printed circuit boards (PCB) for the cell controller ensure open availability. The present data complement numerous extant publications: the Predator data station has been the sole data station for the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) 9.4T FT-ICR MS instrument since July 2004, and several additional Predator data stations are in operation elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectra (FT-ICR-MS) of natural organic matter are complex and consist of several thousands of peaks. The corresponding mass to charge ratios (m/z) and signal intensities result from analytes and noise. The most commonly applied way of distinguishing between analyte and noise is a fixed signal-to-noise ratio below which a detected peak is considered noise. However, this procedure is problematic and can yield ambiguous results. For example, random noise peaks can occur slightly above the signal-to-noise threshold (false positives), while peaks of low abundance analytes may occasionally fall below the fixed threshold (false negatives). Thus, cumulative results from repeated measurements of the same sample contain more peaks than a single measurement. False positive and false negative signals are difficult to distinguish, which affects the reproducibility between replicates of a sample. To target this issue, we tested the feasibility of a method detection limit (MDL) for the analysis of natural organic matter to identify peaks that can reliably be distinguished from noise by estimating the uncertainty of the noise. We performed 556 replicate analyses of a dissolved organic matter sample from the deep North Pacific on a 15 T FT-ICR-MS; each of these replicate runs consisted of 500 cumulated broadband scans. To unambiguously identify analyte peaks in the mass spectra, the sample was also run at time-consuming high-sensitivity settings. The resulting data set was used to establish and thoroughly test a MDL. The new method is easy to establish with software help, does only require the additional analysis of replicate blanks (low time increase), and can implement all steps of sample preparation. Especially when analysis time does not allow for replicate runs, major merits of the MDL are reliable removal of false positive (noise) peaks and better reproducibility, while the risk of losing analytes with low signal intensities (false negative) is comparatively low. When replicate analyses are feasible, the removal of all singly detected peaks is further recommended, as these have the highest probability of being noise peaks. We suggest that the here proposed detection limit should become routine in FT-ICR-MS data processing.},

Pretreatments of Baltic Sea waters in the dark indicated that {\textgreater}72\% of DON was recalcitrant to biological mineralization. When this DON (16‚àí21.5 ŒºM) was exposed to simulated solar radiation, the concentration of NH4+ increased 0.5‚àí2.5 ŒºM more in irradiated waters than in the dark controls. The photochemical production of NH4+ and the dose of absorbed photons were used to calculate the apparent quantum yield spectrum for photoammonification [mol NH4+ (mol photons)-1 nm-1] at wavelengths (Œª) of 290‚àí700 nm (œÜNH4,Œª). The modeled mean rates of photoammonification based on œÜNH4,Œª were 143 and 53 Œºmol NH4+ m-2 d-1 at the surface and in the whole water column, respectively, of Baltic Sea stations during summer. The results of this study indicate that the rate of photoammonification approximately equals and periodically exceeds the rate of atmospheric deposition of reactive inorganic nitrogen to the northern Baltic Sea. For these stratified surface waters beyond riverine input of labile nitrogen, photoammonification can periodically be the largest source of new bioavailable nitrogen.},

	abstract = {The bioavailability of predegraded dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a humic-rich, boreal river to estuarine bacteria from the Baltic Sea was studied in 39-day bioassays. The river waters had been exposed to various degrees of bacterial degradation by storing them between 0 and 465¬†days in dark prior to the bioassay. The resulting predegraded DOM was inoculated with estuarine bacteria and the subsequent changes in DOM quantity and quality measured. During the incubations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and oxygen concentrations decreased, indicating heterotrophic activity. Coloured DOM was degraded less than DOC, indicating a selective utilization of DOM, and humic-like fluorescence components increased during the incubations. The amount of DOC degraded was not affected by the length of DOM predegradation. The percentage of bioavailable DOC (\%BDOC) was higher in experiment units with added inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus than without addition (on average 13.5¬†\% and 9.0, respectively), but had no effect on the degradation of fresh, non-predegraded, DOC (\%BDOC 12.0¬†\%). Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) was highest (65¬†¬±¬†2¬†\%) in the units with fresh DOM, and lowest in units with predegraded DOM and no added inorganic nutrients (11¬†¬±¬†4¬†\%). The addition of inorganic nutrients increased the BGE of predegraded DOM units by an average of 28¬†¬±¬†4¬†\%. There was no significant effect on BGE by length of predegradation after the initial drop ({\textless}3¬†months). This study suggests that both the length of predegradation and the inorganic nutrient status in the receiving estuary has consequences to carbon cycling and will determine the amount of terrestrial-derived DOC being ultimately assimilated into marine food webs.},

The overall lost DOC fraction was similar in clearwater lakes (34.8 ¬± 2.4\%) and in brownwater lakes (37.8 ¬± 1.9\%). Reactivity continuum modeling revealed that the most labile DOC fraction, degrading at rates {\textgreater}0.01 d‚àí1, was larger in the clearwater lakes (11.1 ¬± 1.2\%) than in the brownwater lakes (0.8 ¬± 0.1\%). The initial apparent first-order decay coefficientk was fivefold larger in the clearwater lakes (0.0043 ¬± 0.0012 d‚àí1) than in the brownwater lakes (0.0009 ¬± 0.0003 d‚àí1). Over time, k decreased more steeply in the clearwater lakes than in the brownwater lakes, reaching the k of the brownwater lakes within 5 months. Finally, k averaged 0.0001 d‚àí1 in both lake categories. In the brownwater lakes, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption decayed with an initial k twice as large (0.0018 ¬± 0.0008 d‚àí1) as that of DOC. The initial kwas inversely correlated with initial specific UV absorption and CDOM absorption and positively correlated with initial tryptophan-like fluorescence as proxy for autochthonous DOC. Exposure to simulated sunlight at the end of the incubations caused loss of color in the clearwater lakes and loss of DOC in the brownwater lakes, where subsequent mineralization was also stimulated. The DOC lost in the absence of photochemical processes fell below previously reported watershed-scale losses in Sweden by 25\% at most. This suggests that a major part of the in situ DOC loss could potentially be attributed to dark reactions alone.},

Here we test this hypothesis by tracking the production and isotopic signature of bacterial respiratory CO2 in 2 week lake water incubations and use the resulting data to reconstruct and model the bacterial consumption dynamics of algal and terrestrial DOC. The proportion of algal DOC respired decreased systematically over time in all experiments, suggesting a rapid consumption and depletion of this substrate. Our results further show that the algal DOC pool was used in proportions and at rates twice and 10 times as high as the terrestrial DOC pool, respectively. On the other hand, the absolute amount of labile terrestrial DOC was on average four times higher than labile algal DOC, accounting for almost the entire long-term residual C metabolism, but also contributing to short-term bacterial C consumption. The absolute amount of labile algal DOC increased with chlorophyll a concentrations, whereas total phosphorus appeared to enhance the amount of terrestrial DOC that bacteria could consume, suggesting that the degradation of these pools is not solely governed by their respective chemical properties, but also by interactions with nutrients. Our study shows that there is a highly reactive pool of terrestrial DOC that is processed in parallel to algal DOC, and because of interactions with nutrients, terrestrial DOC likely supports high levels of bacterial metabolism and CO2 production even in more productive lakes.},

	abstract = {We followed a long-term (up to 503¬†days) microbial mineralization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from lake water in a bioassay and described the kinetics of biodegradation with a new model based on a reactivity continuum approach. The biodegradability of DOC was expressed as the probability of biodegradation, which was assumed to follow a beta distribution. We compared the performance of our beta model to five earlier models: the simplest first order kinetic model, two G models, the power model and the gamma model. The simplest first order kinetic model described the decreasing microbial mineralization of DOC poorly (r2¬†=¬†0.73), but the other models explained the observed kinetics of biodegradation well (r2¬†{\textgreater}¬†0.95). When we assessed the extrapolation power of models beyond the length of the bioassay by reducing the amount of data, the predictive power of the G models was poor. Instead, the beta model predicted the biodegradation kinetics consistently and correctly based on even only three observations in time. The beta model provided also long-term predictions (up to 5,000¬†years) along the observed long-term mineralization trajectory of organic carbon in sediments. Additionally, the beta model formulated the biodegradability continuum of DOC, which was skewed towards low biodegradability. During the bioassay, the skew towards low biodegradability increased as the most biodegradable parts of DOC were consumed. The beta model describes the biodegradability continuum quantitatively and can predict biodegradation in a realistic manner, thus, improving our understanding about the biodegradability and the role of natural organic matter in the environment.},

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy was employed to assess leaching behavior, and HLB sorbent was found to leach substantially, among others. Variable DOC recoveries observed for SR DOM and NS DOM were primarily caused by the respective molecular composition, with subordinated and heterogeneous contributions of relative salinity. Scatter of average H/C and O/C elemental ratios and gross alignment in mass-edited H/C ratios according to five established coarse SPE characteristics was near identical for SR DOM and NS DOM. FTMS-based principal component analysis (PCA) provided essentially analogous alignment of SR DOM and NS DOM molecular compositions according to the five established groups of SPE classification, and corroborated the sorption-mechanism-based selectivity of DOM extraction in both cases. Evaluation of structural blanks and leaching of SPE cartridges requires NMR spectroscopy because FT-ICR mass spectrometry alone will not reveal inconspicuous displacements of continual bulk signatures caused by leaching of SPE resin constituents.},

Trace metals such as iron, an essential micronutrient, compete with protons and major ions for the binding to DOM. These competitive effects and the DOM binding capacity are related to the DOM acid-base properties, which also influence DOM transport and reactivity in marine waters. Here we present the results of a complete set of acid-base titration experiments of a pre-concentrated marine DOM sample in the range 0.01¬†‚â§¬†I¬†‚â§¬†0.7¬†M and 3¬†‚â§¬†pH¬†‚â§¬†10.

This carboxylic mode was found to be less acidic and more homogeneous than a generic fulvic acid, but the differences are consistent with the reported variability of fulvic acids of freshwater and terrestrial origin.

	abstract = {Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) constitutes a major carbon pool in the global carbon cycle. Characterization of its chemical composition will improve our understanding of its role in global biogeochemical cycles. Currently, solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analysis has become a powerful approach to characterize the molecular composition of DOM. However, some components in marine DOM, such as highly oxygenated tannin-like molecules, were lost during the SPE process. In this study, a sequential combination of co-precipitation and SPE procedure was proposed to improve the yield of marine DOM extraction. Ferric hydroxide was used as the co-precipitation agent to separate marine DOM, and SPE was carried out for the extraction of DOM from dissolved and precipitate fractions. The total yield in total organic carbon (TOC) and the number of assigned molecules of SPE-DOM increased by 25\% and 51\%, respectively, compared with those by direct SPE process. The combined process has good selectivity on tannin-like compounds. The result is instructive for the understanding of DOM molecular composition and potential for a routine method for DOM extraction from environmental water samples, especially for marine DOM containing a small amount of tannin-like compounds.},

	abstract = {The feasibility of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for extracting dissolved organic matter (DOM) from seawater has been investigated. Solid phase extraction (SPE) operating in column and batch modes was used as an extractive technique, and the latter mode offered better performance. DOM adsorption was achieved using 60mg of MWCNTs per each 250mL of seawater subsample, working at pH 1.0 and under an orbital-horizontal shaking at 180rpm and 25¬∞C for 4h. DOM desorption from the MWCNTs support implied an orbital‚Äìhorizontal shaking (180rpm and 25¬∞C) for 2h using 10mL of a 0.1M sodium hydroxide solution (DOM determination), or using 20mL of alkaline methanol (pH 10.0) for DOM fractionation by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with UV detection at 205nm. A Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyzer with wet DOM oxidation (30\% (m/v) potassium peroxodisulphate in 6.0M phosphoric acid) under super critical conditions and with Non-Dispersive Infra Red (NDIR) for CO2 detection was used for DOM measurements. Calibration covered TOC concentrations within the 0.13‚Äì1000mgL‚àí1 range. The percentage of DOM retained in the MWCNTs support was dependent on the seawater sample, and it varied from 34 to 81\%. This means that only the DOM of certain molecular weights is capable to interact with the SPE support. Various SEC columns, ranging from 100 to 7000 and from 500 to 15,000Da (optimum separation range for peptides), were therefore used for DOM fractionation. Results have shown that DOM of low molecular weight is retained in the MWCNTs (fractions within the ranges of 125‚Äì1102Da and 6.88‚Äì125Da).},

Once in the ocean, this DOM is transported together with elements, particles, dissolved gases and biomass along with the neutrally buoyant plume layer. Considering the number and extent of actively venting hydrothermal sites in the oceans, their contribution to the oceanic DOM pool may be substantial. Here, we investigate the dynamics of DOM in relation to hydrothermal venting and related processes at the as yet unexplored Aurora hydrothermal vent field within the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean at 82.9{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚àò}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} N. We examined the vertical distribution of DOM composition from sea ice to deep waters at six hydrocast stations distal to the active vent and its neutrally buoyant plume layer. In comparison to background seawater, we found that the DOM in waters directly affected by the hydrothermal plume was molecularly less diverse and 5 \%‚Äì10 \% lower in number of molecular formulas associated with the molecular categories related to lipid and protein-like compounds. On the other hand, samples that were not directly affected by the plume were chemically more diverse and had a higher percentage of chemical formulas associated with the carbohydrate-like category. Our results suggest that hydrothermal processes at Aurora may influence the DOM distribution in the bathypelagic ocean by spreading more thermally and/or chemically induced compositions, while DOM compositions in epipelagic and mesopelagic layers are mainly governed by the microbial carbon pump dynamics and surface-ocean‚Äìsea-ice interactions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we present the results of carbon isotope (14C and 13C) and concentration measurements of sedimentary organic carbon (SOC), pore-water dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in sediments collected from the East China Sea, Yellow/Bohai Sea, and South China Sea. Our results indicated that selective degradation and preservation of organic matter occurred in these sediments, and marine-derived young organic carbon degraded preferentially and rapidly, resulting in high concentrations of pore-water DOC and DIC with distinct carbon isotopic signatures. The average 14C age of pore-water DOC was thousands of years younger than that of SOC in the sediment, suggesting that DOC was newly produced and cycled much faster than SOC. Aged SOC was refractory and preserved in sediments. Using a dual-isotope three-end-member model, the contributions of potential sources to SOC, DOC, and DIC were estimated. Marine-derived biomass organic carbon contributed the most to DOC, and dissolution of biogenic carbonate contributed the most to DIC. Riverine inputs of pre-aged soil and fossil organic carbon dominated the SOC pool. Our study demonstrated that marginal sea sediments are important sites of young DOC and DIC fluxes into the water column, thus acting as a major pathway for carbon and nutrient cycling in the ocean.},

	abstract = {Lakes are important sources of methane (CH4), accounting for 6‚Äì16\% of natural global CH4 emissions annually. Vertical spatial resolution of CH4 sampling in the water column of lakes is limited because of physical dimensions of sampling devices and sampling-induced mixing. To improve pool-size estimates of carbon, diffusive flux calculations for CH4, and detailed mechanistic understanding of CH4 dynamics in lakes, more precise vertical profiles of dissolved gases through the water column are vital. We investigate the use of commercially available passive diffusion bags (PDBs) to obtain highly resolved (0.5-m increments) vertical profiles of dissolved CH4 concentrations and isotopic composition (Œ¥13 ). Laboratory experiments determined PDB equilibration time was between 5 d and 9 d for both CH4 concentration and Œ¥13 . During July 2013, PDBs were deployed at intervals of 0.5-m depth for 5 d in two lakes located {\textless} 5 km from the southwestern margin of the Greenland ice cap. Data from PDB samples were compared with samples collected using a submersible, electric pump. In both lakes, PDB and pump samples yielded vertical profiles for CH4 concentration and Œ¥13 that were in close agreement (CH4 concentration R2 = 0.998, p {\textless} 0.001; Œ¥13 R2 = 0.970, p {\textless} 0.001). Overall agreement between PDB and pump samples verifies the applicability of the PDB approach to dissolved CH4 sampling. High-vertical resolution sampling of dissolved gas concentrations and isotopic composition using PDBs can provide more accurate estimates of pool sizes and diffusive fluxes that advance understanding of production, consumption, and emission processes controlling trace gas dynamics in lacustrine environments under warming climate.},

Our calculations are based on a series of algorithms starting with satellite-based primary production and continuing with conversion of primary production to sinking particle flux, penetration of particle flux to the deep sea, and accumulation in sediments. Regional and global budgets from this synthesis highlight the potential importance of shelves and near-shelf regions for carbon burial. While a high degree of uncertainty remains, this analysis suggests that shelves, less than 50 m water depths accounting for 2\% of the total ocean area, may account for 48\% of the global flux of organic carbon to the seafloor. Our estimates of organic carbon and nitrogen flux are in generally good agreement with previous work while our estimates for CaCO3 and SiO2 fluxes are lower than recent work. Interannual variability in particle export fluxes is found to be relatively small compared to intra-annual variability over large domains with the single exception of the dominating role of El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation variability in the central tropical Pacific. Comparison with available sediment-based syntheses of benthic remineralization and burial support the recent theory of mineral protection of organic carbon flux through the deep ocean, pointing to lithogenic material as an important carrier phase of organic carbon to the deep seafloor. This work suggests that models which exclude the role of lithogenic material would underestimate the penetration of POC to the deep seafloor by approximately 16‚Äì51\% globally, and by a much larger fraction in areas with low productivity. Interestingly, atmospheric dust can only account for 31\% of the total lithogenic flux and 42\% of the lithogenically associated POC flux, implying that a majority of this material is riverine or directly erosional in origin.},

Here we report the first in situ measurements of DOC fluxes from continental margin sediments (water depths ranging from 95 to 3,700 m), and compare these fluxes with measured benthic fluxes from 20 other coastal and continental margin sediments. With this combined data set data we have estimated that benthic DOC fluxes are less than ‚àº10\% of sediment carbon oxidation rates, and that the integrated DOC flux from sediments in water depths less than 2,000 m is ‚àº180 Tg C/yr. These fluxes are roughly equivalent to the riverine DOC flux, and the organic carbon burial rate in marine sediments. Benthic DOC fluxes therefore represent an important net source of DOC to the oceans. We also note that: (1) benthic DOC fluxes represent a loss of organic carbon from sediments; (2) in many sediments these fluxes appear to be controlled by molecular diffusion (i.e., by pore water concentration gradients); (3) pore water DOC may be an important intermediate in sediment carbon burial and preservation. These observations therefore suggest a linkage between benthic DOC fluxes and sediment carbon preservation that may be mediated by pore water DOC concentrations and cycling. The magnitude and fate of DOC effluxing from marine sediments is thus important to understanding carbon cycles and budgets in the marine environment.},

In this review, these topics are considered from biochemical, microbial/molecular biological, and geochemical perspectives. Our understanding of the capabilities and limitations of heterotrophic microbial communities has been greatly advanced in recent years, in part through genetic and genomic approaches. New methods to measure enzyme activities in the field are needed to keep pace with these advances and to pursue intriguing evidence that patterns of enzyme activities in different environments are linked to differences in microbial community composition that may profoundly affect the marine carbon cycle.},

For the 1995 spring bloom in the Sargasso Sea, net DOC production was 59-70\% of the net community production. Net DOC production was maximal during the period of deep convective overturn of the water column, indicating linkage between the processes. Following the Sargasso Sea spring bloom and into the summer period, net DOC production was nil over the upper 250 m so that net DOC production was reduced to ‚àº8\% of net community production on a seasonal timescale. Consideration of the various types of production regimes in the ocean indicates that the global net production of semilabile DOC is ‚àº17\% of global new production. Regions of the world's oceans with the greatest contributions to global net community production, such as equatorial and coastal upwelling areas, contribute most to the global production of semilabile DOC.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was isolated from large volumes of deep (674m) and surface (21m) ocean water via reverse osmosis/electrodialysis (RO/ED) and two solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods (XAD-8/4 and PPL) at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA). By applying the three methods to common water samples, the efficiencies of XAD, PPL and RO/ED DOM isolation were compared. XAD recovered 42\% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from deep water (25\% with XAD-8; 17\% with XAD-4) and 30\% from surface water (16\% with XAD-8; 14\% with XAD-4). PPL recovered 61¬±3\% of DOC from deep water and 61\% from surface water. RO/ED recovered 82¬±3\% of DOC from deep water, 14¬±3\% of which was recovered in a sodium hydroxide rinse, and 75¬±5\% of DOC from surface water, with 12¬±2\% in the sodium hydroxide rinse. The highest recoveries of all were achieved by the sequential isolation of DOC, first with PPL and then via RO/ED. This combined technique recovered 98\% of DOC from a deep water sample and 101\% of DOC from a surface water sample. In total, 1.9, 10.3 and 1.6g-C of DOC were collected via XAD, PPL and RO/ED, respectively. Rates of DOC recovery using the XAD, PPL and RO/ED methods were 10, 33 and 10mg-Ch‚àí1, respectively. Based upon C/N ratios, XAD isolates were heavily C-enriched compared with water column DOM, whereas RO/ED and PPL‚ûîRO/ED isolate C/N values were most representative of the original DOM. All techniques are suitable for the isolation of large amounts of DOM with purities suitable for most advanced analytical techniques. Coupling PPL and RO/ED techniques may provide substantial progress in the search for a method to quantitatively isolate oceanic DOC, bringing the entirety of the DOM pool within the marine chemist's analytical window.},

	abstract = {Advances in water chemistry in the last decade have improved our knowledge about the genesis, composition, and structure of dissolved organic matter, and its effect on the environment. Improvements in analytical technology, for example Fourier-transform ion cyclotron (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry (MS), homo and hetero-correlated multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and excitation emission matrix fluorimetry (EEMF) with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis for UV‚Äìfluorescence spectroscopy have resulted in these advances. Improved purification methods, for example ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis, have enabled facile desalting and concentration of freshly collected DOM samples, thereby complementing the analytical process. Although its molecular weight (MW) remains undefined, DOM is described as a complex mixture of low-MW substances and larger-MW biomolecules, for example proteins, polysaccharides, and exocellular macromolecules. There is a general consensus that marine DOM originates from terrestrial and marine sources. A combination of diagenetic and microbial processes contributes to its origin, resulting in refractory organic matter which acts as carbon sink in the ocean. Ocean DOM is derived partially from humified products of plants decay dissolved in fresh water and transported to the ocean, and partially from proteinaceous and polysaccharide material from phytoplankton metabolism, which undergoes in-situ microbial processes, becoming refractory. Some of the DOM interacts with radiation and is, therefore, defined as chromophoric DOM (CDOM). CDOM is classified as terrestrial, marine, anthropogenic, or mixed, depending on its origin. Terrestrial CDOM reaches the oceans via estuaries, whereas autochthonous CDOM is formed in sea water by microbial activity; anthropogenic CDOM is a result of human activity. CDOM also affects the quality of water, by shielding it from solar radiation, and constitutes a carbon sink pool. Evidence in support of the hypothesis that part of marine DOM is of terrestrial origin, being the result of a long-term carbon sedimentation, has been obtained from several studies discussed herein.},

	abstract = {About 20\% of the organic carbon produced in the sunlit surface ocean is transported into the ocean‚Äôs interior as dissolved, suspended and sinking particles to be mineralized and sequestered as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), sedimentary particulate organic carbon (POC) or ‚Äúrefractory‚Äù dissolved organic carbon (rDOC). Recently, the physical and biological mechanisms associated with the particle pumps have been revisited, suggesting that accepted fluxes might be severely underestimated (Boyd et al., 2019; Buesseler et al., 2020). Perhaps even more poorly understood are the mechanisms driving rDOC production and its potential accumulation in the ocean. On the basis of recent conflicting evidence about the relevance of DOC degradation in the deep ocean, we revisit the concept of rDOC in terms of its ‚Äúrefractory‚Äù nature in order to understand its role in the global carbon cycle. Here, we address the problem of various definitions and approaches used to characterize rDOC (such as turnover time in relation to the ocean transit time, molecule abundance, chemical composition and structure). We propose that rDOC should be operationally defined. However, we recognize there are multiple ways to operationally define rDOC; thus the main focus for unifying future studies should be to explicitly state how rDOC is being defined and the analytical window used for measuring rDOC, rather than adhering to a single operational definition. We also conclude, based on recent evidence, that the persistence of rDOC is fundamentally dependent on both intrinsic (chemical composition and structure, e.g., molecular properties), and extrinsic properties (amount or external factors, e.g., molecular concentrations, ecosystem properties). Finally, we suggest specific research questions aimed at stimulating research on the nature, dynamics, and role of rDOC in Carbon sequestration now and in future scenarios of climate change.},

	abstract = {Bacteria play a key role in the planetary carbon cycle partly because they rapidly assimilate labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean. However, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms at work when bacterioplankton metabolize distinct components of the DOM pool is still limited. We, therefore, conducted seawater culture enrichment experiments with ecologically relevant DOM, combining both polymer and monomer model compounds for distinct compound classes. This included carbohydrates (polysaccharides vs. monosaccharides), proteins (polypeptides vs. amino acids), and nucleic acids (DNA vs. nucleotides). We noted pronounced changes in bacterial growth, activity, and transcription related to DOM characteristics. Transcriptional responses differed between compound classes, with distinct gene sets (‚Äúcore genes‚Äù) distinguishing carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids. Moreover, we found a strong divergence in functional transcription at the level of particular monomers and polymers (i.e., the condensation state), primarily in the carbohydrates and protein compound classes. These specific responses included a variety of cellular and metabolic processes that were mediated by distinct bacterial taxa, suggesting pronounced functional partitioning of organic matter. Collectively, our findings show that two important facets of DOM, compound class and condensation state, shape bacterial gene expression, and ultimately select for distinct bacterial (functional) groups. This emphasizes the interdependency of marine bacteria and labile carbon compounds for regulating the transformation of DOM in surface waters.},

Yet, our currently limited understanding of the Arctic Ocean carbon cycle hinders our ability to predict how changing conditions will affect local Arctic ecosystems, regional carbon budgets, and global climate. We present here the first set of concurrent, full-depth, dual-isotope profiles for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and suspended particulate organic carbon (POCsusp) at two sites in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean. The carbon isotope composition of sinking and suspended POC in the Arctic contrasts strongly with open ocean Atlantic and Pacific sites, pointing to a combination of inputs to Arctic POCsusp at depth, including surface-derived organic carbon (OC), sorbed/advected OC, and OC derived from in situ DIC fixation. The latter process appears to be particularly important at intermediate depths, where mass balance calculations suggest that OC derived from in situ DIC fixation contributes up to 22\% of POCsusp. As in other oceans, surface-derived OC is still a dominant source to Arctic POCsusp. Yet, we suggest that significantly smaller vertical POC fluxes in the Canada Basin make it possible to see evidence of DIC fixation in the POCsusp pool even at the bulk isotope level.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Summary 382 VIII. Acknowledgment 383 References 383 In accomplishing successful electrospray ionization analyses, it is imperative to have an understanding of the effects of variables such as analyte structure, instrumental parameters, and solution composition. Here, we review some fundamental studies of the ESI process that are relevant to these issues. We discuss how analyte chargeability and surface activity are related to ESI response, and how accessible parameters such as nonpolar surface area and reversed phase HPLC retention time can be used to predict relative ESI response. Also presented is a description of how derivitizing agents can be used to maximize or enable ESI response by improving the chargeability or hydrophobicity of ESI analytes. Limiting factors in the ESI calibration curve are discussed. At high concentrations, these factors include droplet surface area and excess charge concentration, whereas at low concentrations ion transmission becomes an issue, and chemical interference can also be limiting. Stable and reproducible non-pneumatic ESI operation depends on the ability to balance a number of parameters, including applied voltage and solution surface tension, flow rate, and conductivity. We discuss how changing these parameters can shift the mode of ESI operation from stable to unstable, and how current‚Äìvoltage curves can be used to characterize the mode of ESI operation. Finally, the characteristics of the ideal ESI solvent, including surface tension and conductivity requirements, are discussed. Analysis in the positive ion mode can be accomplished with acidified methanol/water solutions, but negative ion mode analysis necessitates special constituents that suppress corona discharge and facilitate the production of stable negative ions. ¬© 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 20: 362‚Äì387, 2001; Published online in Wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com).

	abstract = {This paper proposes improved guidelines for dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolation by solid phase extraction (SPE) with a styrene‚Äìdivinylbenzene copolymer (PPL) sorbent, which has become an established method for the isolation of DOM from natural waters, because of its ease of application and appreciable carbon recovery. Suwannee River water was selected to systematically study the effects of critical SPE variables such as loading mass, concentration, flow rate, and up-scaling on the extraction selectivity of the PPL sorbent. High-field Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy were performed to interpret the DOM chemical space of eluates, as well as permeates and wash liquids with molecular resolution. Up to 89\% dissolved organic carbon (DOC) recovery was obtained with a DOC/PPL mass ratio of 1:800 at a DOC concentration of 20 mg/L. With the application of larger loading volumes, low proportions of highly oxygenated compounds were retained on the PPL sorbent. The effects of the flow rate on the extraction selectivity of the sorbent were marginal. Up-scaling had a limited effect on the extraction selectivity with the exception of increased self-esterification with a methanol solvent, resulting in methyl ester groups. Furthermore, the SPE/PPL extract exhibited highly authentic characteristics in comparison with original water and reverse osmosis samples. These findings will be useful for reproducibly isolating DOM with representative molecular compositions from various sources and concentrations and minimizing potential inconsistencies among interlaboratory comparative studies.},

In Experiment 1, late L2 learners and native speakers performed measures of English working memory, decoding, and speed, and a grammaticality judgment task. Compared to native speakers, late L2 learners were poorer on all measures. L2 span, L2 decoding ability, and arrival age correlated with L2 judgment accuracy. Late L2 learners had less difficult judging some structures (e.g., word order, questions) than others (e.g., articles, regular past). To simulate these deficits, Experiment 2 placed native speakers under stressors relevant to memory (low or high digit load), decoding (noise), or speed (response deadline, compressed speech) during grammaticality judgment. Span and decoding scores correlated with judgment under relevant stressors. The stressors caused native speakers to show selective deficits in judgment, with some structures (e.g., word order) being less vulnerable to stress than others (e.g., regular past). Performance of natives under noise or memory stress paralleled that of late L2 learners, indicating a role for decoding and memory abilities in explaining poor grammaticality judgment.},

	abstract = {This study presents the findings of cross-sectional psycholinguistic research 
investigating the first-language acquisition of Turkish among heritage speakers 
in Germany. Studies in heritage language acquisition in the last decades have 
provided increasing evidence that heritage speakers do not always converge on 
the grammars of native speakers, which is predominantly explained in relation 
to estimates of reduced input and output conditions. Nonetheless, Montrul 
(2010) underlines the fact that estimates of input cannot be used as 
measurements and addresses the need for a well-established theoretical 
framework that will account for the development of heritage speakers‚Äô linguistic 
system to explain why heritage speakers succeed - or fail - in language 
acquisition in the ways that they do. This study aims to fill this gap by looking at 
the phenomena from a developmental perspective within the formalisms of 
Processability Theory (Pienemann, 1998, 2005), a well-established crosslinguistic 
approach to acquisition based on the architecture of the human 
language processor, but which has not previously been applied to Turkish. This 
study investigated the grammatical competence of twenty-four young heritage 
speakers of Turkish in Germany by testing their online processing of various 
Turkish grammatical structures, focusing on passives and subject relative 
clauses. The results demonstrate that the language acquisition of Turkish 
heritage speakers is developmentally constrained by availability of processing 
mechanisms. The participants displayed a clear hierarchy in their development, 
with competence in the processing of basic grammatical structures that are 
canonically mapped, but with gaps in the processing of complex structures such 
as passives and subject relative clauses that are non-canonically mapped and 
involve long-distance dependencies. This study thus contributes important 
insights both to theoretical accounts of acquisition of Turkish, and to the wider 
study of heritage language acquisition.},

We examine whether heritage speakers learning a foreign language as an early L3 transfer grammatical properties from the heritage language or the dominant second language (L2).Design/Methodology/Approach:We used a sentence repetition task and a picture story retelling task. The tasks focussed on grammatical phenomena that were either different between English and German, that is, verb-second and adverb order, or between English and German, on the one hand, and Turkish, on the other, that is, verb-complement order as well as subject and article realization.Data and Analysis:We tested matched groups of 31 Turkish-German and 31 monolingual German children learning English in grades 3 and 4, and we compared sentence repetitions as well as oral sentence production across different grammatical phenomena using parametric statistics.Findings/Conclusions:In both tasks, the two groups perform indistinguishably from each other, and both groups show selective transfer of grammatical properties from German. These findings suggest L2 transfer from a typologically related language in sequential child L3 acquisition.Originality:This paper breaks new ground by testing the applicability of formal models of adult L3 acquisition of grammar to sequential child L3 learners. It uses aural comprehension and oral production tasks with carefully matched groups of L2 and L3 learners of English to isolate the source of grammatical transfer in L3 acquisition.Significance/Implications:The research advances our understanding of cross-linguistic influence and unravels the dynamics of grammatical transfer in early child multilingualism. It adjudicates between current models of transfer in L3 acquisition in a multiple-methods design, it shows that these models apply to early L3 acquisition of heritage speakers, and it highlights that these models need to be expanded to include factors such as dominance and proficiency in prior languages.},

We investigated this issue by examining the so-called ‚Äúsubject preference‚Äù in Turkish, a language which allows for a natural (unmarked) object reading of an initial ambiguous argument. Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we observed increased processing difficulty in the form of a broadly distributed positivity when an initial ambiguous argument was disambiguated towards an object reading. This effect was independent of the animacy (i.e. semantic subject prototypicality) of the ambiguous argument. Our results therefore speak in favour of a universal tendency to interpret the first argument encountered as the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù of the clause, even in languages providing no obvious structural motivation for such a strategy. However, we argue that the underlying explanation for this preference must be modified in accordance with cross-linguistic considerations.},

The study examines whether overlapping structures in the two languages result in influences of the dominant L2 German on the weaker L1 Turkish in morphosyntactic processing. Plural-marking on noun phrases was chosen for investigation since it provides an ideal test case and it constitutes partial overlap in German and Turkish. Since various definitions of CLI describe effects of this phenomenon that relate to language processing, behavioral measures are utilized in this research. The analyses of accuracy rates reveal that the two languages are clearly differentiated from each other. However, the bilingual speakers perform better with respect to the construction, which is only available in Turkish, compared to the overlapping structure between the languages. This indicates that the speakers separate the two languages from each other. However, interlanguage cue competition is at play in morphosyntactic processing in the L1 heritage language. The effects of heritage language proficiency are also examined by means of comparing high- and low-to-intermediate heritage speakers. The proficiency effects on L1 processing can be found in processing speed but not in accuracy rates. High-to-intermediate speakers do not differ from monolinguals in their processing speed, whereas the low-to-intermediate speakers perform slower than both the monolinguals and the high-to-intermediate heritage speakers. We discuss these findings within Modular Online Growth and Use of Language (MOGUL), which is a processing-based linguistic framework that accounts for the interaction of the two languages in the bilingual mind.},

The earlier studies on subject pronoun use in Turkish spoken by Turkish-Dutch bilinguals did not find any difference from monolingual speakers of Turkish but reported a few instances of unconventional use of subject pronouns, indicating the influence of Dutch on Turkish. This study aimed to determine whether structural priming may have a part in the unconventional variation observed in subject pronoun use in Turkish in contact with Dutch. Twenty-eight Turkish-Dutch bilinguals listened to short stories and responded to subsequently presented instructive sentences. These sentences were prime sentences, which contained either an overt or a null subject pronoun. Priming effects were investigated in monolingual and bilingual settings by presenting the stories in Turkish in the former and in Dutch in the latter. Results yielded a higher likelihood of using overt subject pronouns in the bilingual than in the monolingual setting following a prime sentence with an overt rather than a null pronoun. Our findings, which are based on a structure and a language that have not yet been studied much in relation to structural priming (i.e., subject pronoun use in Turkish), strengthen the empirical basis of how structural priming influences syntactic choices in language contact settings.},

	abstract = {Heritage language bilingualism refers to contexts where a minority language spoken at home is (one of) the first native language(s) of an individual who grows up and typically becomes dominant in the societal majority language. Heritage language bilinguals often wind up with grammatical systems that differ in interesting ways from dominant-native speakers growing up where their heritage language is the majority one. Understanding the trajectories and outcomes of heritage language bilingual grammatical competence, performance, language usage patterns, identities and more related topics sits at the core of many research programs across a wide array of theoretical paradigms. The study of heritage language bilingualism has grown exponentially over the past two decades. This expansion in interest has seen, in parallel, extensions in methodologies applied, bridges built between closely related fields such as the study of language contact and linguistic attrition. As is typical in linguistics, not all languages are studied to the same degree. The present volume showcases what Turkish as a heritage language brings to bear for key questions in the study of heritage language bilingualism and beyond. In many ways, Turkish is an ideal language to be studied because of its large diaspora across the world, in particular Europe. The papers in this volume are diverse: from psycholinguistic, to ethnographic, to classroom-based studies featuring Turkish as a heritage language. Together they equal more than their subparts, leading to the conclusion that understudied heritage languages like Turkish provide missing pieces to the puzzle of understanding the variables that give rise to the continuum of outcomes characteristic of heritage language speakers.},

On this view, the basic concepts are those of ‚Äògrammar‚Äô and ‚Äòknowledge of grammar‚Äô. The concepts of language‚Äô and ‚Äòknowledge of language‚Äô are derivative: they involve a higher level of abstraction from psychological mechanisms and raise additional (though not necessarily important) problems. Of central concern, from this point of view, will be to determine the biological endowment that makes it possible for a grammar of the required sort to develop in human beings provided that they are exposed to some appropriate body of experience. This biological endowment may be regarded as a function that maps a body of experience into a particular grammar. The function itself is commonly referred to as universal grammar (u.g.) and can be expressed, in part, as a system of principles that determine the class of accessible particular grammars and their properties. Recent work suggests that u.g. consists, on the one hand, of a theory of so-called core grammar and, on the other, of a theory of permissible extensions and modifications of core grammar. Given the intricate internal structure of u.g., it can account for the superficially highly diverse grammars and languages that do in fact exist. Thus, what appear to be quite different systems of knowledge may arise from relatively little experience. A number of subsystems of u.g. have now been explored, each with its distinctive properties and possibilities of variation. Some current proposals concerning these systems are sketched, and some consequences considered with regard to the nature and acquisition of cognitive systems (including systems of knowledge) more generally.},

Then they realize how difficult it is to get the pronunciation right, to acquire the meaning of thousands of new words, and to learn how those words are put together to form sentences. Children, however, have mastered language before they can tie their shoes. In this engaging and accessible book, William O'Grady explains how this happens, discussing how children learn to produce and distinguish among sounds, their acquisition of words and meanings, and their mastery of the rules for building sentences. How Children Learn Language provides readers with a highly readable overview not only of the language acquisition process itself, but also of the ingenious experiments and techniques that researchers use to investigate his mysterious phenomenon. It will be of great interest to anyone - parent or student - wishing to find out how children acquire language.},

This predicts that Russian syntactic properties will help children learn English Adv-V word order and overcome Norwegian V2 influence. In order to verify these predictions, we tested three groups of 12-14-year-old English learners: L1 Norwegian, L1 Russian, and 2L1 Norwegian-Russian, matched for general English proficiency. The data suggest that while L1 Norwegian children over-accept ungrammatical sentences in English with Norwegian word order (V-Adv), the bilingual children notice these errors more often due to the facilitating influence of Russian.},

Specifically, does the L1 maintain a privileged role in all subsequent language acquisition or is it possible that all languages known can play a role in subsequent language acquisition? Results from several ongoing L3 acquisition studies investigating adults and children learning English as an L3, whose L1 is Kazakh and whose L2 is Russian, are reported in this paper. We compare the learners' patterns of acquisition in production of three types of restrictive relative clauses. Adults are compared to children; speakers are compared at comparable levels of linguistic competence in the languages. Results indicate that the L1 does not play a privileged role in subsequent acquisition. At the same time, results indicate subtle differences between adults and children. We argue that such findings would not be possible in the context of an L1 or L2 study alone. Results are used to support the proposed Cumulative Enhancement Model for Language Acquisition.},

	abstract = {Several models have been proposed to account for the neurocognitive basis of the mental lexicon (a repository of stored words) and the mental grammar (which captures the regularities of language). The declarative/procedural model argues that lexicon and language depend on two neural systems that are intensively studied in the context of memory: declarative and procedural memory. The declarative/procedural model links lexicon with the declarative system and with brain structures in temporal/temporoparietal regions. On the other hand, the model links grammar with the procedural system, and with structures in the basal ganglia and frontal cortex. The declarative/procedural model makes a set of specific predictions about the neurocognitive basis of lexicon and grammar, regarding their separability, computation, domain generality and localization. These predictions, which have been thoroughly tested in the context of the use of regular versus irregular word forms (walk‚Äìwalked versus go‚Äìwent), have been helpful in contrasting this model with other competing perspectives. Several lines of evidence support the declarative/procedural model over alternative views. This evidence has come from psycholinguistic studies, the analysis of developmental disorders of language, neurological cases, haemodynamic studies and neurophysiological observations. Collectively, the data show a double dissociation. On the one hand, there is a link between lexicon, associative-memory markers, the knowledge of facts and events, and temporal/temporoparietal regions. On the other, there is a link between grammar, motor and cognitive skills, and structures in the frontal lobe and the basal ganglia. The declarative/procedural model has several implications. First, studies of declarative and procedural memory should help to elucidate the neural bases of lexicon and grammar, and vice versa. Second, the model has clinical implications for people with developmental or adult-onset disorders of grammar, as they might recover through the memorization of complex forms using the declarative system. Last, the existence of systems that subserve language in humans and are homologous to systems present in other animals has implications for the evolution of language.},

	abstract = {Several studies on L3 lexicon, and recently also some on L3 syntax, have convincingly shown a qualitative difference between the acquisition of a true L2 and the subsequent acquisition of an L3. Some studies even indicate that L2 takes on a stronger role than L1 in the initial state of L3 syntax (e.g. Bardel and Falk, 2007; Rothman and Cabrelli Amaro, 2010). In this article we further investigate syntactic transfer from L1/L2 to L3 in learners at an intermediate level of proficiency in the target language. Data have been obtained from 44 learners of German as L3, testing the placement of object pronouns in both main and subordinate clauses in a grammaticality judgement/correction task (GJCT). The learners constitute two groups (both n = 22): One group has English as L1 and French as L2 and the other group has French as L1 and English as L2. This particular combination of background languages allows us to pinpoint the source of transfer, since object placement is pre-verbal in French and post-verbal in English, this being applied in both main and subordinate clauses. In target language (TL) German, however, the object placement varies between pre-verbal in the sub clause and post-verbal in the main clause. The two groups behave differently as to both acceptance and rejection of the test items (60 grammatical and ungrammatical main and sub clauses with object pronouns). This difference is significant and can be ascribed to their L2s, respectively. Our results thus show that the L2 transfers into the L3 even at an intermediate level, and on the basis of this we claim a strong role for the L2 status factor.},

We target CLI in L3 English based on bilingual heritage speakers (Russian-German and Turkish-German) in comparison with second language acquisition of monolingual German speakers.Methodology:We examine the outcome of an English word order test. The participants produced sentences based on randomly ordered words. The focus of this study is the placement of direct and indirect pronominal objects with varying ditransitive verbs.Data analysis:195 students in school years 7 and 9, separated into three language groups, participated in the study: German monolinguals (nG7 = 47; nG9 = 64), Russian-German bilinguals (nR7 = 19; nR9 = 30) and Turkish-German bilinguals (nT7 = 19; nT9 = 16). The placement of pronominal objects in the sentence task is compared to results from equivalent word order tests in English, German, Russian and Turkish that were repeated with native speakers.Findings:We find some support for the Linguistic Proximity Model because the outcome shows that facilitative and non-facilitative CLI is possible from both the heritage language and the majority language. Determining factors are the background languages, the age of the participants and frequency. However, the majority language, German, displays the strongest influence of both background languages due to its dominant status.Originality:This study provides further support for the Linguistic Proximity Model, by using a sentence completion task with unbalanced bilingual heritage speakers.Significance/implications:We provide evidence for showing that both facilitative and non-facilitative influence from all previously known languages of bilingual heritage speakers is possible and verifiable. We therefore add to the field of L3 acquisition and the discussion about current models of CLI.},

I discuss the ways in which the opportunity of broadening SLA-and-instruction research can be seized by current researchers so that it can address the most intractable educational problems involving language. Drawing from current research on bilingualism, I first describe the challenges of providing language instruction for heritage speakers and examine the bilingualism of these unique language learners. I then offer an overview of the questions raised by the study of heritage language learners. Finally, I describe communities of professional practice and existing disciplinary boundaries and conclude with a discussion of the ways in which the field of SLA can draw from other areas in order to affect the educational futures of language minority children around the world and, at the same time, contribute to our greater understanding of the human language faculty.},

Critical questions arise as to how their linguistic knowledge compares to that of post puberty L2 learners. Focusing on recent experimental research on grammatical domains typically affected in both L2 learners and heritage speakers, this article addresses whether exposure to the family language since birth even under reduced input conditions leads to more native-like linguistic knowledge in heritage speakers as opposed to L2 learners with a later age of acquisition of the language, how differences in input and language learning experience determine the behavioral manifestations of linguistic knowledge, and whether formal instruction in the classroom is beneficial to heritage speakers. I argue that the extension of theoretical frameworks and methodologies from SLA has significantly advanced the field of heritage language acquisition, but deeper understanding of these speakers will also need more fruitful integration of the psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic factors that contribute to the acquisition and maintenance of heritage languages.},

The goal is to see whether HSs have the representation of passives in their mental grammars and to better understand the relative weight of factors (age at time of testing, immigration status of the Turkish parents (first or second generation), and literacy in the L1) that potentially contribute to the formation of HSs‚Äô grammatical competence.

There was a significant effect of only literacy; high level of L1 literacy has a positive effect on monolingual-like production as compared to those with no literacy.

Specifically for bilingual acquisition, the paper relies on findings from studies on young bilingual children who together are acquiring 13 languages in 14 different combinations. The data available to date strongly suggest that in essence, bilingual and monolingual children go through the primary language development process in fundamentally similar ways. There are also striking similarities between bilingual and monolingual children for one particular language-in-acquisition. The acquisition process, then, appears to be very robust, and quite immune to the fact whether a child is growing up with two languages or just one.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on an experimental study investigating the acquisition of grammatical gender in Russian by heritage speakers living in Norway. The participants are 54 Norwegian-Russian bilingual children (4;0‚Äì10;2) as well as 107 Russian monolingual controls (3;0‚Äì7;0). Previous research has shown that grammatical gender is problematic for bilingual speakers, especially in cases where gender assignment is opaque (Polinsky, 2008; Schwartz et al., 2015; Rodina and Westergaard, 2017). Furthermore, factors such as proÔ¨Åciency and family type (one or two Russian-speaking parents) have been argued to be important. Interestingly, previous Ô¨Åndings differ with respect to the kind of errors children make: restructuring to a two-gender system (masculine‚Äìfeminine, see Polinsky, 2008) or defaulting to masculine (see Rodina and Westergaard, 2017). It is also not clear to what extent children are sensitive to gender cues or whether certain agreement patterns are simply memorized. To investigate this, we used both existing nouns and nonce words and tested both transparent and opaque gender cues. The results were checked against a number of background factors measuring exposure, proÔ¨Åciency, and dominance. Our Ô¨Åndings show that bilingual children are clearly sensitive to morphophonological cues for gender assignment. The most common and robust error pattern for all bilinguals involved overgeneralization to masculine (especially affecting neuter and opaque nouns). At the same time, children from families with two Russian-speaking parents and monolinguals also occasionally overused feminine with vowel-Ô¨Ånal nouns. The following variables were found to be the most reliable predictors of accuracy on grammatical gender tasks: cumulative length of exposure (CLoE) and consistency of input in Russian, as well as the presence of older siblings, with CLoE to Russian being by far the most robust and important predictor. Furthermore, we show that a lexical diversity measure (number of different words in a Russian narrative) is also correlated signiÔ¨Åcantly with the children‚Äôs performance on the gender tasks. At the same time, our results indicate that relative measures of dominance (e.g., the difference in exposure between the two languages or the difference in narrative scores) may be redundant when more robust absolute measures are present (CLoE and lexical diversity in the heritage language).},

Minority languages are rich reflection of multiethnic cultures and societies and carry a wealth of linguistic, historical, social, cultural, and anthropological information. Since these languages are under constant threat of marginalization and extinction, any attempt to protect and revitalize them would contribute to keep the linguistic diversity for future generation. As will be discussed, the idea of English as the killer language is simplification of a more complex phenomenon. For this purpose, first roles of minority languages are reviewed, next the literature for language shift and death is investigated and three challenging issues which seem to be concerns of global spread of English are discussed, then new roles of English in global scale are explored.

The diffusion of English is seen in terms of three concentric circles: the Inner Circle (L1 varieties, e.g. the USA and the UK), the Outer Circle (ESL varieties), and the Expanding Circle (EFL varieties). The discussion is essentially restricted to the Outer Circle in which the institutionalized non-native varieties of English are used in multilingual and multicultural contexts. The discussion is about four major issues: theoretical, applied, societal and ideological, and focuses specifically on: (a) attitudes concerning the ontological status of the varieties of English, (b) generalizations about the creative strategies used for learning English in multilingual/multicultural contexts, (c) descriptions of the pragmatic and interactional contexts of WEs and their implications, (d) assumptions concerning multicultural identities of WEs, (e) assumptions about the role of English in initiating ideological and social change, and (f) assumptions about communicative competence in English. This paper is divided into the following sections: ontological issues, conflict between idealization and reality, acquisition and creativity, the ‚Äòleaking paradigms‚Äô, cultural content of English, ideological change, where applied linguistics fails the Outer Circle of English, and types of fallacies about WEs. This study does not view applied linguistics as divorced from social concerns: the concerns of relevance to the society in which we live. This view, then, entails social responsibility and accountability for research in applied linguistics.},

Very little attention has been paid so far to the communicative needs of the second language learners who may not share the standards of communicative competence that the native speakers of the target language value. Recent studies of non-native varieties of English establish beyond doubt the fact that these varieties differ from the native varieties of English precisely because their users have norms of communicative competence entirely different from those of native speakers of English. In this paper, evidence is presented to show that the development and institutionalization of nonnative varieties of English around the world pose a serious problem for all existing theories of SLA. The issues that need to be addressed in future research are clearly identified.},

Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants read sentences with grammatical and ungrammatical verbs, in which the plurality of the subject noun phrase was either doubly marked (via overt plural quantification and morphological marking on the noun) or singly marked (via only plural morphology on the noun). Both acceptability judgments and the ERP data showed heightened sensitivity to agreement violations when quantification provided an additional cue to the grammatical number of the subject noun phrase, over and above plural morphology. This is consistent with models of grammatical comprehension that emphasize feature prediction in tandem with cue-based memory retrieval. Our results additionally contrast with those of prior studies that showed no effects of plural quantification on agreement in language production. These findings therefore highlight some nontrivial divergences in the cues and mechanisms supporting morphosyntactic processing in language production and comprehension.},

knowledge type (receptive vs. expressive). Experiment 1 uses event-related potentials
to examine noun-adjective number (present in L1) and gender agreement (absent in
L1) in online sentence comprehension (receptive knowledge). For each feature,
markedness was manipulated, such that half of the critical noun-adjective
combinations were feminine (marked) and the other half, masculine; half were used in
the plural (marked) and the other half in the singular. With this set-up, we examined
learners' potential overreliance on unmarked forms or "defaults" (singular/masculine).
Experiment 2 examines similar dependencies in spoken sentence production
(expressive knowledge). Results showed that learners (n=22) performed better with
number than gender overall, but their brain responses to both features were
qualitatively native-like (i.e., P600), even though gender was probed with nouns that do
not provide strong distributional cues to gender. In addition, variability with gender
agreement was better accounted for by lexical (as opposed to syntactic) aspects.
Learners showed no advantage for comprehension over production. They also showed
no systematic evidence of reliance on morphological defaults, although their online
processing was sensitive to markedness in a native-like manner. Overall, these results
suggest that there is facilitation for properties of the L2 that exist in the L1 and that
markedness impacts L2 processing, but in a native-like manner. These results also
speak against proposals arguing that adult L2ers have deficits at the level of the
morphology or the syntax.},

Thirty-six Korean speakers of L2 English and 32 native English speakers read 40 stimulus sentences, half of which contained subject‚Äìverb agreement violations in English. The factors were whether a head and a local intervening noun matched in number and whether a sentence was grammatical or not. In linear mixed models analyses, both agreement violations and noun phrase match/mismatch were found to be disruptive in processing for native speakers at the critical regions (verb and following word), and locally distracting number-marked nouns yielded an asymmetric pattern depending on grammaticality. When L2 speakers were asked to produce offline oral translations of the English sentences into Korean, they became more sensitive to agreement violations. In addition, higher L2 proficiency predicted greater sensitivity to morphological violations. The results indicate that L2 speakers are not necessarily insensitive to morphological violations and that L2 proficiency and task modulate the depth of L2 morphological processing.},

To investigate this, we examined subject-verb agreement processing in English by L1 Mandarin participants using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and focused on the use of quantificational cues to noun number and their interaction with agreement morphology on the verb. Previous work in English monolinguals has shown that agreement violations elicited larger P600s when preceded by a plurally quantified subject NP compared to an unquantified NP. In the present study, Mandarin speakers were tested on the same quantified and unquantified sentences (e.g., Most/The cookies taste/*tastes‚Ä¶) as in the prior work. Like the L1 English speakers, ERPs time-locked to the verb showed a reliable P600 in response to agreement violations. However, the P600 in Mandarin speakers was larger for ungrammatical verbs with unquantified subjects, a contrast with English monolinguals. First, these results demonstrate that L2 agreement violations can elicit qualitatively similar neural responses in L1 Mandarin speakers as in English monolinguals (P600 effects), a finding which is to our knowledge novel. Second, quantification modulated the P600 in the L2 speakers in a qualitatively different way than in natives. Overall, these findings suggest stronger reliance on lexical versus morphological cues to number in Mandarin speakers, and that this impacts anticipation of subsequent grammatical features.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The present investigation is to study the impact of yoga and meditation on Brain waves concerning physical and mental health. There are mainly three stages (steps) in the brain wave classification:(i) preprocessing, ii) feature extraction, and iii) classification. This work provides a review of interpretation methods of Brain signals (Electroencephalogram (EEG)) EEG during yoga and meditation. Past research has revealed significant mental and physical advantages with yoga and meditation.
Methods
The research topic reviewed focused on the machine learning strategies applied for the interpretation of brain waves. In addressing the research questions highlighted earlier in the general introduction, we conducted a systematic search of articles from targeted scientific and journal online databases that included PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore Digital Library (IEEE), and Arxiv databases based on their relevance to the research questions and domain topic. The survey topic is relatively nascent, and therefore, the scope of the search period was limited to the 20-year timeline that was deemed representative of the research topic under investigation. The literature search was based on the keywords ‚ÄúEEG‚Äù, ‚Äúyoga*‚Äù and ‚Äúmeditation*‚Äú. The key phrases were concatenated using Boolean expressions and applied to search through the selected online databases yielding a total of 120 articles. The online databases were selected based on the relevancy of content with the research title, research questions, and the domain application. The literature review search, process, and classification were carefully conducted guided by two defined measures; 1.) Inclusion criteria; and 2.) Exclusion criteria. These measures define the criteria for searching and extracting relevant articles relating to the research title and domain of interest.
Results
Our literature search and review indicate a broad spectrum of neural mechanics under a variety of meditation styles have been investigated. A detailed analysis of various mental states using Zen, CHAN, mindfulness, TM, Rajayoga, Kundalini, Yoga, and other meditation styles have been described by means of EEG bands. Classification of mental states using KNN, SVM, Random forest, Fuzzy logic, neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks has been described. Superior research is still required to classify the EEG signatures corresponding to different mental states.
Conclusions
Yoga practice may be an effective adjunctive treatment for a clinical and aging population. Advanced research can examine the effects of specific branches of yoga on a designated clinical grouping. Yoga and meditation increased overall healthy brain activity.},

Together, the findings highlight the role of proficiency for processing the target language since it is only at near-native levels of proficiency that non-natives converge on native-like parsing.

	abstract = {The parameters of the human memory system constrain the operation of language comprehension processes. In the memory literature, both decay and interference have been proposed as causes of forgetting; however, while there is a long history of research establishing the nature of interference effects in memory, the effects of decay are much more poorly supported. Nevertheless, research investigating the limitations of the human sentence processing mechanism typically focus on decay-based explanations, emphasizing the role of capacity, while the role of interference has received comparatively little attention. This paper reviews both accounts of difficulty in language comprehension by drawing direct connections to research in the memory domain. Capacity-based accounts are found to be untenable, diverging substantially from what is known about the operation of the human memory system. In contrast, recent research investigating comprehension difficulty using a retrieval-interference paradigm is shown to be wholly consistent with both behavioral and neuropsychological memory phenomena. The implications of adopting a retrieval-interference approach to investigating individual variation in language comprehension are discussed.},

Ten advanced Arab learners of English and four native speakers of English are tested on a written grammaticality judgment task and an oral production task. Three hypotheses are tested: (1) the grammatical knowledge of advanced Arab learners of English indirect questions is different from that of native speakers of English, (2) advanced Arab learners of English do not have problems acquiring indirect questions, where the matrix clause is a non-interrogative clause and the embedded clause is an interrogative clause, (3) advanced Arab learners of English have problems acquiring indirect questions, where both the matrix clause and the embedded clause are interrogative. The results of the study confirm the first and third hypotheses but disconfirm the second hypothesis. The results of the study provide counter evidence to the interface hypothesis, as even linguistic properties that do not involve interface between syntax and discourse/pragmatics seem to be persistently problematic at the advanced level of L2 proficiency.},

This research provides supporting evidence for the IH as it reveals that attrition affects structures at the syntax-pragmatics interface but not structures requiring the satisfaction of semantic conditions. This chapter also reviews research that supports Sorace√ïs (2011, 2016) proposal that individual L1 attrition affects only the ability to process interface structures but not knowledge representations, as it reveals that attrition only affects online sensitivity with structures at the syntax-pragmatics interface rather than causing a permanent change in speakers√ï L1 knowledge representations.},

Unsubstantiated beliefs about what language technology can and cannot do inside or outside the language classroom often influence decisions about the choice of language technology to be used. The declarative/procedural model, which makes a clear distinction between the declarative and procedural memory systems, can help to provide an objective, neuroscience-informed evaluation of language technology. The central argument in this paper is that language technology caters predominantly to the declarative memory system. This system is very effective in forming explicit metalinguistic knowledge but does not lead to automatic production or procedural ability. For technology to promote procedural ability, it should instead cater to the procedural memory, which involves the implicit neurofunctional computational system. This paper provides a language technology evaluation flowchart to help professionals evaluate the language technology products they will use and gauge their expectations of those products more realistically. It also provides a list of factors to be taken into account in maximizing the benefits of technology.},

Metrics of grey matter (thickness, volume, and surface area) and white matter (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) were examined across 41 cortical and subcortical brain structures and 20 tracts, respectively. We used generalized additive modelling to analyze whether, how, and where the developmental trajectories of bilinguals and monolinguals might differ. Bilingual and monolingual participants manifested distinct developmental trajectories in both grey and white matter structures. As compared to monolinguals, bilinguals showed: (a) more grey matter (less developmental loss) starting during late childhood and adolescence, mainly in frontal and parietal regions (particularly in the inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis, superior frontal cortex, inferior and superior parietal cortex, and precuneus); and (b) higher white matter integrity (greater developmental increase) starting during mid-late adolescence, specifically in striatal‚Äìinferior frontal fibers. The data suggest that there may be a developmental basis to the well-documented structural differences in the brain between bilingual and monolingual adults.},

They are also useful when the dependent variable involves repeated measures, since GLMMs can model autocorrelation. This study aimed to determine how and how often GLMMs are used in psychology and to summarize how the information about them is presented in published articles. Our focus in this respect was mainly on frequentist models. In order to review studies applying GLMMs in psychology we searched the Web of Science for articles published over the period 2014‚Äì2018. A total of 316 empirical articles were selected for trend study from 2014 to 2018. We then conducted a systematic review of 118 GLMM analyses from 80 empirical articles indexed in Journal Citation Reports during 2018 in order to evaluate report quality. Results showed that the use of GLMMs increased over time and that 86.4\% of articles were published in first- or second-quartile journals. Although GLMMs have, in recent years, been increasingly used in psychology, most of the important information about them was not stated in the majority of articles. Report quality needs to be improved in line with current recommendations for the use of GLMMs.},

	abstract = {Second language (L2) learners often have persistent difficulty with agreement between the number of the subject and the number of the verb. This study tested whether deviant L2 verb number agreement reflects maturational constraints on acquiring new grammatical features or resource limitations that impede access to the representations of L2 grammatical features. L1-Chinese undergraduate students at three age of arrival (AoA) levels were tested for online verb agreement accuracy by completing preambles in three animacy combinations: animate‚Äìinanimate [AI; e.g., The officer(s) from the station(s)], inanimate‚Äìanimate [IA; e.g., The letters from the lawyer(s)], and inanimate‚Äìinanimate [II; e.g., The poster(s) from the museum(s)]. AI should be less costly to process than IA or II sequences, because animacy supports the subject in AI but competes with the subject for control of agreement in IA sequences, and is neutralized in II. Agreement accuracy was greater overall for AI than for IA or II, and although an AoA-related increase in erroneous agreement after plural subjects occurred for IA and II, there were no AoA effects for AI. Higher scores on memory tasks were associated with greater agreement accuracy, and the memory tasks significantly predicted variance in erroneous agreement when AoA was partialed out. The fact that even late learners can do verb agreement in the case of AI demonstrates that they can acquire new grammatical features. The greater difficulty with agreement in the case of IA or II than of AI, in conjunction with the results for the memory tasks, supports the resource limitation hypothesis.},

Mixed linear regression analyses find effects of reading span on attachment preferences across tasks in the L2 group. In addition, relative-clause attachment was modulated by slowdowns in lexical processing, which indicates that difficulties in word-level processing affect L2 parsing behavior. Nonnatives who were matched in capacity to native speakers showed target-like syntactic processing. In terms of the interaction of capacity and structural parsing preferences, L2ers pattern similarly to natives, which supports continuity approaches to L2 processing.},

Our major source of evidence for this claim comes from experimental psycholinguistic studies investigating morphological and syntactic processing in child and adult native speakers, and nonnative speakers who acquired their L2 after childhood and for whom their L1 is the dominant language. With respect to child L1 processing, we argued for a continuity of parsing hypothesis claiming that the child's structural parser is basically the same as that of mature speakers and does not change over time. Adult L2 learners, in contrast, were seen to underuse syntactic information during sentence processing and to rely more on lexical‚Äìsemantic cues to interpretation. To account for the observed L1/L2 differences in processing, we proposed the shallow structure hypothesis (SSH) according to which the representations adult L2 learners compute during processing contain less syntactic detail than those of child and adult native speakers.},

However, these effects are difficult to find in studies investigating young adults. One problem is that there is no standard definition of bilingualism or means of evaluating degree of bilingualism in individual participants, making it difficult to directly compare the results of different studies. Here, we describe an instrument developed to assess degree of bilingualism for young adults who live in diverse communities in which English is the official language. We demonstrate the reliability and validity of the instrument in analyses based on 408 participants. The relevant factors for describing degree of bilingualism are: (1) the extent of non-English language proficiency and use at home, and (2) non-English language use socially. We then use the bilingualism scores obtained from the instrument to demonstrate their association with: (1) performance on executive function tasks, and (2) previous classifications of participants into categories of monolinguals and bilinguals.},

In a pre-/posttest control group design, two experiments with intermediate to advanced German‚ÄìEnglish learners examine whether massed exposure to informative input leads to adaptation in L2 processing in that L2 readers come to integrate inflection in real-time comprehension. Experiment 1 on case marking shows that input causing prediction error and flagging the target parse leads to nativelike integration of case in the reanalysis of garden-path sentences. Experiment 2 shows partially nativelike processing of adverbial‚Äìverb tense mismatches after exposure to target input. Adaptation was selective to the experimental versus the control group in processing, yet it did not generalize to offline, explicit performance. We conclude that morphosyntactic adaptation constitutes an implicit learning mechanism in L2 processing, and we discuss its implications for models of L2 processing and acquisition.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and empirical aspects of the neural bases of the mental lexicon and the mental grammar in first and second language (L1 and L2) are discussed. It is argued that in L1, the learning, representation, and processing of lexicon and grammar depend on two well-studied brain memory systems. According to the declarative/procedural model, lexical memory depends upon declarative memory, which is rooted in temporal lobe structures, and has been implicated in the learning and use of fact and event knowledge. Aspects of grammar are subserved by procedural memory, which is rooted in left frontal/basal-ganglia structures, and has been implicated in the acquisition and expression of motor and cognitive skills and habits. This view is supported by psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic evidence. In contrast, linguistic forms whose grammatical computation depends upon procedural memory in L1 are posited to be largely dependent upon declarative/lexical memory in L2. They may be either memorized or constructed by explicit rules learned in declarative memory. Thus in L2, such linguistic forms should be less dependent on procedural memory, and more dependent on declarative memory, than in L1. Moreover, this shift to declarative memory is expected to increase with increasing age of exposure to L2, and with less experience (practice) with the language, which is predicted to improve the learning of grammatical rules by procedural memory. A retrospective examination of lesion, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological studies investigating the neural bases of L2 is presented. It is argued that the data from these studies support the predictions of the declarative/procedural model.},

At the same time, the IH was extended to bilingual first language (L1) acquisition and to the very early stages of L1 attrition, which exhibit optionality in precisely the same structures: this provides a unifying framework for the study of bilingual language development.

	abstract = {In this master‚Äôs thesis, we test the Bottleneck Hypothesis (Slabakova 2006; 2008; 2013) in L2 acquisition of English by Norwegian speakers.  According to this hypothesis, functional morphology is the bottleneck of L2 acquisition, i.e. the most challenging part for L2 learners to acquire. We test two constructions that do not match in English and Norwegian: subject-verb agreement and verb movement. The former represents knowledge of functional morphology and the latter represents knowledge of syntax.  
 
To elaborate, Norwegian is a V2 language in which finite verbs move to the second position in non-subject-initial declaratives. In contrast, English has no verb movement out of VP in these types of sentences. Hence, the learning task for Norwegian speakers of English is to unlearn the V2 rule.  Westergaard (2003) has shown that this is a major challenge for Norwegian learners at an early stage. Regarding morphology, English marks present simple tense verbs when the subject is 3rd person singular, whereas Norwegian has no overt subject-verb agreement.  
 
Our results indicate that agreement is not only significantly more difficult for the L2 learners, but also a more persistent problem as the learners become more advanced speakers. This suggests that learners develop more in their knowledge of English word order than of agreement. We conclude that our findings lend support to the Bottleneck Hypothesis.},

	abstract = {The present review focuses on event-related potential (ERP) studies that have addressed two fundamental issues in bilingualism research, namely the processing of a first versus a second language in the bilingual brain and the issue of control of two languages. A major advantage of the ERP technique is its high temporal resolution that enables the study of task-related neural activity at the millisecond level. For example, ERP studies of bilingualism have shown that developmental changes in the ability to discriminate native and foreign speech sounds can experimentally be traced by the presence or absence of a specific ERP component (the mismatch negativity). They have also revealed latency delays in a semantic-related ERP component (the N400) in bilinguals compared to monolinguals, as well as in bilinguals reading in their L1 or L2 language. These studies have also highlighted the importance of L2 proficiency level and age of acquisition on bilingual language processing. Moreover, ERP studies have pointed out potential mechanisms of avoidance of interference between languages (the NoGo N200 effect). The present review aims to describe and integrate the main results of the selected ERP studies on bilingualism and to provide an overview of how different ERP components can be used to address important theoretical questions in this field. Finally, we suggest potential research directions to clarify unresolved issues and to advance this emerging field of research.},

Behavioral and ERP results suggest both groups detected nonlocal agreement violations, indexed by a P600 effect. Moreover, the manipulation of determiner-number specification revealed a facilitation effect across the board in both grammaticality judgment and ERP responses for both groups: increased judgment accuracy and a larger P600 effect amplitude for sentences containing violations with demonstratives rather than bare determiners. Contrary to some claims regarding the potential for nonnative processing, the present data suggest that L1 and L2 speakers show similar ERP responses when processing agreement, even when the L1 lacks the relevant distinction.},

Although there is considerable evidence for L2 influence on vocabulary acquisition in L3, not all researchers believe that such influence generalizes to morphosyntactic aspects of the grammar. For example, H√•kansson et al. (2002) introduce the Developmentally Moderated Transfer Hypothesis (DMTH), which incorporates transfer in Processability Theory (PT). They argue against syntactic transfer from L2 to L3. The present study presents counter-evidence to this hypothesis from two groups of learners with different L1s and L2s acquiring Swedish or Dutch as L3. The evidence clearly indicates that syntactic structures are more easily transferred from L2 than from L1 in the initial state of L3 acquisition. The two groups behave significantly differently as to the placement of negation, a difference that can be attributed to the L2 knowledge of the learners in interaction with the typological relationship between the L2 and the L3.},

The Dynamic Model of the evolution of New Englishes, which builds upon the mutual identity definitions by the parties involved in a colonization process and describes five consecutive phases of evolution, is sketched briefly. It is shown that the early history of English in Malaysia, from the establishment of the colony of Penang to independence, conforms nicely to the generalizations made for the first two phases, called ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù and ‚Äúexonormative stabilization‚Äù and marked by gradually expanding elite bilingualism and slight linguistic transfer. Malaysia‚Äôs nationalist language policy of the 1960s and after impeded the further expansion and development of English in the country; nevertheless, it is shown that Malaysian English has progressed deeply into the third phase of ‚Äúnativization‚Äù, being widely used in the country in various domains and employed as a carrier of a local identity having developed distinctive features of its own. Recent redirections of educational policy have given new weight and impetus to English in Malaysia in a complex sociolinguistic setting.},

This article argues that despite all obvious dissimilarities, a fundamentally uniform developmental process, shaped by consistent sociolinguistic and language-contact conditions, has operated in the individual instances of rerooting the English language in another territory. At the heart of this process there are characteristic stages of identity construction by the groups involved, with similar relationships between the parties in migration contact settings (i.e. the indigenous population and immigrant groups, respectively) having resulted in analogous processes of mutual accommodation and, consequently, similar sociolinguistic and structural outcomes. Outlining a basic developmental scenario, I suggest that speech communities typically undergo five consecutive phases in this process‚Äîfoundation, exonormative stabilization, nativization, endonormative stabilization, and differentiation‚Äîand I describe the sociolinguistic characteristics of each one. This framework is then applied to case studies of seven different countries (Fiji, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand) which, I argue, are currently positioned at different points along the developmental cycle.*},

The importance of the issues raised here is related to the multidimensional character of the spread of English; the unique sociolinguistic contexts of English across cultures; the ‚Äòlove-hate‚Äô attitudes toward the language; and the development of CONTACT LITERATURES in world Englishes (e.g., in South and West Asia, South, West and East Africa). It is argued that, to explore the all-pervasive impact of English, interdisciplinary research is needed on various literatures of the world; processes of literary creativity; introduction of new or modified literary genres; expansion of the thematic range; patterning of the discoursal and stylistic strategies, and issues of ideology and power. The discussion is divided into the following major sections: The spheres of Englishization; Deficit vs. dominance hypothesis; Exponents of Englishization; Englishization beyond the sentence; ‚ÄòGreat tradition‚Äô vs. ‚ÄòLittle tradition‚Äô; Thematic range and literary experimentation; Englishization and code development; Englishization and linguistic schizophrenia; Contact linguistics and language policies.

Considerable attention has been paid to the lexis, morphology and syntactic constructions, as also the sound system. Yet, the investigation is far from over, nor is there agreement on issues. Recent work has moved in the direction of corpus-based studies, enabling the establishment of tendencies and grammaticalised forms in a quantified manner. Acoustic phonetic studies are increasingly the norm. These empirically verified conclusions either negate or confirm earlier intuition-based and impressionistic descriptions. Together, these works help to establish what makes up the national variety, the standard and variation. Two theoretical debates emerge in this scenario. The first is the nature and extent of substrate influence and its intersection with L2 universals. The second is a debate on the phase to which Indian English belongs in Schneider‚Äôs dynamic model of evolution for New Englishes: phase 3 of nativisation or phase 4 of endonormative stabilisation.},

What emerges from much of the discussion, however, is that there seems to be a good deal of uncertainty as to what, precisely, ELF actually is, and how it relates to the much more firmly established field of world Englishes (WE). This paper therefore begins with an explanation of my own interpretation of both WE and ELF. It goes on to focus primarily on ELF. First, I examine two frequent and diametrically opposite reactions to ELF: one that it promotes monolithicity and denies pluricentricity, the other that it promotes too much diversity, lack of standards, and an approach in which ‚Äòanything goes‚Äô. I then consider the attitudes implicit in the second of these positions, and, using data drawn from recent ELF research, go on to explore the possible effects of these attitudes on the identities of ELF speakers from Expanding Circle countries. The paper ends on an optimistic note, with evidence from participants in the European Union's Erasmus Programme1 that demonstrates how first-hand experience of ELF communication seems to be raising their awareness of its communicative effectiveness.},

The conventional multilevel thresholding methods are efficient for bi-level thresholding. However, they are computationally expensive when extended to multilevel thresholding since they exhaustively search the optimal thresholds to optimize the objective functions. To overcome this problem, two successful swarm-intelligence-based global optimization algorithms, cuckoo search (CS) algorithm and wind driven optimization (WDO) for multilevel thresholding using Kapur‚Äôs entropy has been employed. For this purpose, best solution as fitness function is achieved through CS and WDO algorithm using Kapur‚Äôs entropy for optimal multilevel thresholding. A new approach of CS and WDO algorithm is used for selection of optimal threshold value. This algorithm is used to obtain the best solution or best fitness value from the initial random threshold values, and to evaluate the quality of a solution, correlation function is used. Experimental results have been examined on standard set of satellite images using various numbers of thresholds. The results based on Kapur‚Äôs entropy reveal that CS, ELR-CS and WDO method can be accurately and efficiently used in multilevel thresholding problem.},

Kachru 1983; Platt, Weber and Ho 1984; Cheshire 1991) ; however, quantitative evidence of this divergence remains scarce. Through an analysis of a range of Indian English speakers in a contact situation in the United States, this study distinguishes developing dialect features from second language learning features and explores the concomitant emergence of dialect consciousness. First, an implicational analysis shows that some non-standard variables (past marking, copula use, agreement) exhibit a second language learning cline while others (articles) form a more stable, incipient non-standard system shared to some extent by all speakers; a multivariate analysis suggests that both sets of variables are governed by proficiency levels. Next, the explanatory scope of proficiency is assessed by examining the use of selected phonological variants (rhoticity, l-velarization, aspiration). The use of these features resembles native-like style-shifting, as it appears to be more sensitive to speakers‚Äô attitudinal stances than to proficiency levels. This points to the importance of understanding emerging speaker awareness and perceptions of stigma, risk, and value in new varieties of English.},

This achievement is, however, so ubiquitous and mundane that we seldom marvel at it. Of course, monolingual adult grammars may also differ from one another, especially for some domains of grammar (e.g., DƒÖbrowska, 1997, 2012), but such variability pales in comparison to the variation in adult non-native second language (L2) grammars. Indeed, the path and outcomes of L2 acquisition can be highly variable from one individual to another, even under seemingly comparable contexts. Individual and group-level factors in adulthood that either do not apply or apply with much less consequence in young childhood conspire to explain at least some of the gamut of L2 variability.},

In its simplest form, dependency locality holds that words linked in a syntactic dependency (any head‚Äìdependent relationship) should be close in linear order. We give large-scale corpus evidence that dependency locality predicts word order in both grammar and usage, beyond what would be expected from independently motivated principles, and demonstrate a means for dissociating grammar and usage in corpus studies. Finally, we discuss previously undocumented variation in dependency length and how it correlates with other linguistic features such as head direction, providing a rich set of explananda for future linguistic theories.*},

	abstract = {The purpose of this longitudinal study was to investigate differences in reading acquisition processes between children learning to read in their native language and children learning to read in a second language. The author studied Dutch children and Turkish children as they learned to read in Dutch during the first two grades of primary school in the Netherlands. The children were given a number of tasks to test the efficiency of both word recognition (for words of varying familiarity and complexity) and comprehension processes (including text coherence, anaphoric reference, and inferences). The Turkish children were found to be less efficient in various reading processes in Dutch than their monolingual Dutch peers. However, there was evidence from both word recognition and reading comprehension tasks that Turkish and Dutch children rely on highly comparable strategies. The results from both series of tasks as well as data on the Turkish children's oral proficiency in Dutch and their sociocultural orientation were combined into a structural model to examine the interactions between the various reading processes in Dutch. During the first two grades, both word recognition and reading comprehension appear to be most strongly influenced by children's oral proficiency in the second language. This finding suggests that children learning to read in a second language should be helped to build up their oral skills, and that reading instruction should be matched to those skills. /// [French] Le but de cette recherche longitudinale √©tait d'√©tudier les diff√©rences dans l'apprentissage de la lecture en langue maternelle et en langue seconde.

Los autores estudiaron ni√±os holandeses y turcos que estaban aprendiendo a leer en holand√©s durante los dos primeros grados de escuela primaria en Holanda.

They elegantly handle the multiple comparisons problem in high-dimensional magnetoencephalographic and EEG data. Unfortunately, the power of this procedure comes hand in hand with the allure for unwarranted interpretations of the inferential output, the most prominent of which is the overestimation of the temporal, spatial, and frequency precision of statistical claims. This leads researchers to statements about the onset or offset of a certain effect that is not supported by the permutation test. In this article, we outline problems and common pitfalls of using and interpreting cluster-based permutation tests. We illustrate these with simulated data in order to promote a more intuitive understanding of the method. We hope that raising awareness about these issues will be beneficial to common scientific practices, while at the same time increasing the popularity of cluster-based permutation procedures.},

Nevertheless, both recruit roughly the same brain areas (spatially overlapping networks in the left frontotemporal cortex) and happen at the same time (in the first few hundred milliseconds after word onset). We tested the hypothesis that semantic and syntactic unification are segregated by means of neuronal synchronization of the functionally relevant networks in different frequency ranges: gamma (40 Hz and up) for semantic unification and lower beta (10‚Äì20 Hz) for syntactic unification. EEG power changes were quantified as participants read either correct sentences, syntactically correct though meaningless sentences (syntactic prose), or sentences that did not contain any syntactic structure (random word lists). Other sentences contained either a semantic anomaly or a syntactic violation at a critical word in the sentence. Larger EEG gamma-band power was observed for semantically coherent than for semantically anomalous sentences. Similarly, beta-band power was larger for syntactically correct sentences than for incorrect ones. These results confirm the existence of a functional dissociation in EEG oscillatory dynamics during sentence level language comprehension that is compatible with the notion of a frequency-based segregation of syntactic and semantic unification.},

	abstract = {For native speakers, many studies suggest a link between oscillatory neural activity in the beta frequency range and syntactic processing. For late second language (L2) learners on the other hand, the extent to which the neural architecture supporting syntactic processing is similar to or different from that of native speakers is still unclear. In a series of four experiments, we used electroencephalography to investigate the link between beta oscillatory activity and the processing of grammatical gender agreement in Dutch determiner-noun pairs, for Dutch native speakers, and for German L2 learners of Dutch. In Experiment 1 we show that for native speakers, grammatical gender agreement violations are yet another among many syntactic factors that modulate beta oscillatory activity during sentence comprehension. Beta power is higher for grammatically acceptable target words than for those that mismatch in grammatical gender with their preceding determiner. In Experiment 2 we observed no such beta modulations for L2 learners, irrespective of whether trials were sorted according to objective or subjective syntactic correctness. Experiment 3 ruled out that the absence of a beta effect for the L2 learners in Experiment 2 was due to repetition of the target nouns in objectively correct and incorrect determiner-noun pairs. Finally, Experiment 4 showed that when L2 learners are required to explicitly focus on grammatical information, they show modulations of beta oscillatory activity, comparable to those of native speakers, but only when trials are sorted according to participants' idiosyncratic lexical representations of the grammatical gender of target nouns. Together, these findings suggest that beta power in L2 learners is sensitive to violations of grammatical gender agreement, but only when the importance of grammatical information is highlighted, and only when participants' subjective lexical representations are taken into account.},

This prolonged development may be related to differing engagement of semantic and syntactic processes. This study used event related potentials and time frequency analysis of EEG to identify developmental differences in neural engagement as children (ages 10‚Äì12) and adults performed an auditory verb agreement grammaticality judgment task. Adults and children revealed very few differences in comprehending grammatically correct sentences. When identifying grammatical errors, however, adults displayed widely distributed beta and theta power decreases that were significantly less pronounced in children. Adults also demonstrated a significant P600 effect, while children exhibited an apparent N400 effect. Thus, when identifying subtle grammatical errors in real time, adults display greater neural activation that is traditionally associated with syntactic processing whereas children exhibit greater activity more commonly associated with semantic processing. These findings support previous claims that the cognitive and neural underpinnings of syntactic processing are still developing in adolescence, and add to them by more clearly identifying developmental changes in the neural oscillations underlying grammatical processing.},

Both violations elicited power decreases (event-related desynchronization, ERD) in the 8‚Äì30 Hz frequency range, but with different scalp topographies. In addition, semantic anomalies elicited power increases (event-related synchronization, ERS) in the 1‚Äì5 Hz frequency band. The 1‚Äì5 Hz ERS was strongly phase-locked to stimulus onset and highly correlated with time domain averages, whereas the 8‚Äì30 Hz ERD response varied independently of these. In addition, the results showed that language expertise modulated 8‚Äì30 Hz ERD for syntactic violations as a function of the executive demands of the task. When the executive function demands were increased using a grammaticality judgment task, bilinguals but not monolinguals demonstrated reduced 8‚Äì30 Hz ERD for syntactic violations. These findings suggest a putative role of the 8‚Äì30 Hz ERD response as a marker of linguistic processing that likely represents a separate neural process from those underlying ERPs.},

While traditional generative accounts consider V2 to be a parameter, this study shows that, in many languages, this word order is dependent on fine distinctions in syntax and information structure. Thus, within a split-CP model of clause structure, a number of micro-cues are formulated, taking into account the specific context for V2 vs. non-V2 (clause type, subcategory of the elements involved, etc.). The micro-cues are produced in children¬ís I-language grammars on exposure to the relevant input. Focusing on a dialect of Norwegian, the book shows that children generally produce target-consistent V2 and non-V2 from early on, indicating that they are sensitive to the micro-cues. This includes contexts where word order is dependent on information structure. The children¬ís occasional non-target-consistent behavior is accounted for by economy principles.},

Against this background, we have conducted a detailed study of grammatical processing in language learners using experimental psycholinguistic techniques and comparing different populations (mature native speakers, child first language [L1] and adult second language [L2] learners) as well as different domains of language (morphology and syntax). This article presents an overview of the results from this project and of other previous studies, with the aim of explaining how grammatical processing in language learners differs from that of mature native speakers. For child L1 processing, we will argue for a continuity hypothesis claiming that the child's parsing mechanism is basically the same as that of mature speakers and does not change over time. Instead, empirical differences between child and mature speaker's processing can be explained by other factors such as the child's limited working memory capacity and by less efficient lexical retrieval. In nonnative (adult L2) language processing, some striking differences to native speakers were observed in the domain of sentence processing. Adult learners are guided by lexical‚Äìsemantic cues during parsing in the same way as native speakers, but less so by syntactic information. We suggest that the observed L1/L2 differences can be explained by assuming that the syntactic representations adult L2 learners compute during comprehension are shallower and less detailed than those of native speakers.},

The first group consisted of native speakers of Chinese, the second, native speakers of Spanish, and the third, native English speakers. The two learner groups were divided into those who had begun learning English at a younger (less than 15 years) or older (more than 15 years) age. Performance was measured for both accuracy of judgement and time taken to respond. The results showed that performance patterns were different for the two learner groups, that the linguistic structure tested in the item affected participants' ability to respond correctly, and that task modality produced reliable response differences for the two learner groups. Although there were proficiency differences in the grammaticality judgement task between the younger and older Spanish learners, there were no such differences for the Chinese group. Furthermore, age of learning influenced achieved proficiency through all ages tested rather than defining a point of critical period. The results are interpreted as failing to provide sufficient evidence to accept the hypothesis that there is a critical period for second language acquisition.},

Fifty-nine L1 English, Dutch and Russian advanced to near-native L2 speakers of German were tested on their ultimate attainment of case marking, subject‚Äìverb agreement and gender concord. Different off-line and on-line tasks were employed. Cross-linguistic and cross-experiment comparisons of native and non-native performance show that native-like ultimate attainment of L2 inflection is possible for postpubescent learners in L2 grammar and L2 processing. Non-target-like L2 inflection is systematically related to L1 transfer and limitations in L2 processing efficiency. In conjunction, these findings argue against a critical period for morphosyntax in L2 acquisition; rather, they suggest that non-native and native grammars and processing systems are fundamentally identical, with L2 systems being computationally less efficient due to L1 influence.},

Recent attempts to unify linguistic theory and brain science have grown out of recognition that a proper understanding of language in the brain must reflect the steady advances in linguistic theory of the last forty years. The first Mind Articulation Project Symposium addressed two main questions: How can the understanding of language from linguistic research be transformed through the study of the biological basis of language? And how can our understanding of the brain be transformed through this same research? The best model so far of such mutual constraint is research on vision. Indeed, the two long-term goals of the Project are to make linguistics and brain science mutually constraining in the way that has been attempted in the study of the visual system and to formulate a cognitive theory that more strongly constrains visual neuroscience. The papers in this volume discuss the current status of the cognitive/neuroscience synthesis in research on vision, whether and how linguistics and neuroscience can be integrated, and how integrative brain mechanisms can be studied through the use of noninvasive brain-imaging techniques.

Our results show that DLT integration cost is not a significant predictor of reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. However, DLT successfully predicts reading times for nouns. We also find evidence for integration cost effects at auxiliaries, not predicted by DLT. For surprisal, we demonstrate that an unlexicalized formulation of surprisal can predict reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. Comparing DLT integration cost and surprisal, we find that the two measures are uncorrelated, which suggests that a complete theory will need to incorporate both aspects of processing complexity. We conclude that eye-tracking corpora, which provide reading time data for naturally occurring, contextualized sentences, can complement experimental evidence as a basis for theories of processing complexity.},

In this article, we review common methods of spectral decomposition of EEG, time-frequency analyses, types of measures that separately quantify magnitude and phase information from the EEG, and the influence of parameter choices on the analysis results. We then compare the degree of phase locking (ie, phase-locking factor) of the gamma band (36‚Äì50 Hz) response evoked about 50 milliseconds following the presentation of standard tones in 22 healthy controls and 21 medicated patients with schizophrenia. These tones were presented as part of an auditory oddball task performed by subjects while EEG was recorded from their scalps. The results showed prominent gamma band phase locking at frontal electrodes between 20 and 60 milliseconds following tone onset in healthy controls that was significantly reduced in patients with schizophrenia (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.03). The finding suggests that the early-evoked gamma band response to auditory stimuli is deficiently synchronized in schizophrenia. We discuss the results in terms of pathophysiological mechanisms compromising event-related gamma phase synchrony in schizophrenia and further attempt to reconcile this finding with prior studies that failed to find this effect.},

It is contested, however, whether such effects arise due to a faulty representation of relevant morphosyntactic features, or as a result of memory retrieval. Existing studies of agreement attraction in comprehension have largely been limited to subject-verb number agreement, primarily in English, and while attraction in other agreement phenomena such as gender has been investigated in production, very few studies have focused on gender attraction in comprehension. We conducted five experiments investigating noun-adjective gender agreement during comprehension in Spanish. Our results indicate attraction effects during online sentence processing that are consistent with approaches ascribing attraction to interference during memory retrieval, rather than to a faulty representation of agreement features. We interpret our findings as consistent with the predictions of cue-based parsing.},

In two eye-tracking experiments we examined the impact of structurally illicit noun phrases on the computation of reflexive and subject‚Äìverb agreement. Experiment 1 directly compared the two dependencies within participants. Results show a clear difference in the intrusion profile associated with each dependency: agreement resolution displays clear intrusion effects in comprehension (as found by Pearlmutter et al., 1999, Wagers et al., 2009), but reflexives show no such intrusion effect from illicit antecedents (Sturt, 2003, Xiang et al., 2009). Experiment 2 replicated the lack of intrusion for reflexives, confirming the reliability of the pattern and examining a wider range of feature combinations. In addition, we present modeling evidence that suggests that the reflexive results are best captured by a memory retrieval mechanism that uses primarily syntactic information to guide retrievals for the anaphor‚Äôs antecedent, in contrast to the mixed morphological and syntactic cues used resolve subject‚Äìverb agreement dependencies. Despite the fact that agreement and reflexive dependencies are subject to a similar morphological agreement constraint, in online processing comprehenders appear to implement this constraint in distinct ways for the two dependencies.},

In the present paper, we investigate attraction interference during language comprehension, focusing on the contexts in which interference arises and the time-course of these effects. Using evidence from event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and sentence judgment times, we show that agreement attraction in comprehension is best explained as morphosyntactic interference during memory retrieval. This stands in contrast to attraction as involving the representation of the subject NP‚Äôs root-node number feature, which is a strong contributor to attraction in production. We thus argue that the cognitive antecedents of agreement attraction in comprehension are non-identical with those of attraction in production, and moreover, that attraction in comprehension is primarily a consequence of similarity-based interference in cue-based memory retrieval processes. We suggest that mechanisms responsible for attraction during language comprehension are a subset of those involved in language production.},

We find that despite having a richer morphology, Spanish speakers show reliable attraction effects in comprehension, and that these effects are strikingly similar to those previously found in English in their magnitude and distributional profile. Further, we use distributional analyses to argue that cue-based memory retrieval is used as an error-driven mechanism in comprehension.

The first task elicited speeded judgments to verb number violations in sentences that contained plural genitive modifiers. We addressed whether these modifiers elicited attraction errors, which have supported the use of a memory retrieval mechanism in monolingual comprehension studies. The second task examined the comprehension of a language-specific constraint of Turkish against plural-marked verbs with overt plural subjects. Bilinguals showed a reduced application of this constraint, as compared to Turkish monolinguals. Critically, both groups showed similar rates of attraction, but the bilingual group accepted ungrammatical sentences more often. We propose that the similarity in attraction rates supports the use of the same retrieval mechanism, but that bilinguals have more problems than monolinguals in the mapping of morphological to abstract agreement features during speeded comprehension, which results in increased acceptability of ungrammatical sentences.},

	abstract = {We report two parallel experiments conducted in French and in English in which we induced subject-verb agreement errors to explore the role of syntactic structure during sentence production. Previous studies have shown that attraction errors (i.e., a tendency of the verb to agree with an immediately preceding noun instead of with the subject of the sentence) occur when a preverbal local noun disagrees in number with the subject head noun. The attraction effect was accounted for either by the proximity of the local noun to the verb in the linearised sentence (linear distance hypothesis) or by the processing simultaneity of the head and local nouns situated in the same clause (clause packaging hypothesis). In the current experiments, speakers were asked to complete complex sentential preambles. Contrary to the predictions of these two hypotheses, we found that agreement errors were more frequent following an intermediate modifier (e.g., *The threat-S to the presidents-P of the company-S ARE serious) than an immediately preverbal modifier (e.g., *The threat-S to the president-S of the companies-P ARE serious). It is suggested that attraction is determined by the syntactic distance between the interfering noun and the head noun at a stage of the grammatical encoding of the sentence during which syntactic units are organised into a hierarchical structure.},

In Russian, the nominative plural forms of some nouns coincide not only with their accusative plural forms but also with the genitive singular. In one production and two comprehension experiments, such genitive singular forms were found to trigger larger attraction effects than morphologically unambiguous genitive plural forms.

We also provide a quantitative random-effects meta-analysis of eyetracking and self-paced reading studies. We show that the empirical evidence is only partly consistent with cue-based retrieval as implemented in the ACT-R-based model of sentence processing by Lewis and Vasishth (2005) (LV05) and that there are important differences between the reviewed dependency types. In non-agreement subject-verb dependencies, there is evidence for inhibitory interference in configurations where the correct dependent fully matches the retrieval cues. This is consistent with the LV05 cue-based retrieval account. By contrast, in subject-verb agreement as well as in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent dependencies, no evidence for inhibitory interference is found in configurations with a fully cue-matching subject/antecedent. In configurations with only a partially cue-matching subject or antecedent, the meta-analysis reveals facilitatory interference in subject-verb agreement and inhibitory interference in reflexives/reciprocals. The former is consistent with the LV05 account, but the latter is not. Moreover, the meta-analysis reveals that (i) interference type (proactive versus retroactive) leads to different effects in the reviewed dependency types and (ii) the prominence of the distractor strongly influences the interference effect. In sum, the meta-analysis suggests that the LV05 needs important modifications to account for the unexplained interference patterns and the differences between the dependency types. More generally, the meta-analysis provides a quantitative empirical basis for comparing the predictions of competing accounts of retrieval processes in sentence comprehension.},

	abstract = {Memory access mechanisms such as cue-based retrieval have come to dominate theories of the processing of linguistic dependencies such as subject-verb agreement. One phenomenon that has been regarded as demonstrating the role of such mechanisms is the grammaticality asymmetry in agreement attraction, which is the observation that nouns other than the grammatical controller of agreement can influence the computation of subject-verb agreement in ungrammatical, but not grammatical, sentences. This asymmetry is most often accounted for via the dynamics of retrieval interference. We challenge this interpretation, arguing that the asymmetry largely reflects response bias. Three forced-choice judgment experiments show that neutralizing response bias results in a decrease in the size of the grammaticality asymmetry, or its elimination altogether. Together with the response time patterns in these experiments, this result favors an account that attributes attraction effects to a continuous and equivocal representation of number, rather than to the dynamics of retrieval interference. We implement a model of grammaticality judgments that links a continuous representation of number to the rate of evidence accumulation in a diffusion process. This model accounts for the presence or absence of the grammaticality asymmetry through shifts in the decisional starting point (i.e. response bias), and highlights the importance of monitoring for response bias effects in judgment tasks.},

When the head noun (key), local noun (cabinet), and verb were all singular, reading times after the verb were faster than when either a plural local noun or plural verb was present. Experiment 2 used an eyetracking paradigm and revealed a pattern like that in Experiment 1, with a finer grain of resolution. Agreement computations influenced processing within one word after encountering the verb, and processing disruptions occurred in response to both agreement violations and locally distracting number-marked nouns, despite the fact that neither is a priori relevant for comprehension in English. Experiment 3 revealed an asymmetry in the pattern of disruptions that parallels error distributions in language production (e.g., Bock \& Miller, 1991). The results suggest that agreement is an early, integral component of comprehension, mediated by processes similar to those of production.},

The processing of this type of construction gives new insights into the understanding of agreement processes during language comprehension. Here, we contrasted oscillatory brain activity triggered by Unagreement in different EEG bands with those triggered by Standard Agreement and Person Mismatch sentences. In Spectral Power analysis, a similar pattern for Unagreement to that elicited by Person Mismatch was found in lower beta and alpha bands, approximately around 600 ms. This suggests that fast oscillations reÔ¨Çect the evaluation of the feature match between two structurally related constituents (independently of its grammaticality). In an equivalent time window, the Unagreement condition behaves similarly to the Standard Agreement condition in the theta band, but different from the Person Mismatch condition that shows an enhanced spectral power. In addition, an enhanced phase synchrony in lower beta frequency around 600 ms is associated to standard agreement patterns, while beta-high frequencies at 800 ms characterize processing of Unagreement sentences. These results support the functional dissociation between the evaluation of the feature match between two structurally related constituents (independently of its grammaticality‚Äîin fast oscillatory bands) and integration of linguistic material in working memory (reÔ¨Çected by theta oscillations). Successful resolution of an agreement dependency is better reÔ¨Çected in phase synchronizations at beta band.},

	abstract = {Research on language comprehension using event-related potentials (ERPs) reported distinct ERP components reliably related to the processing of semantic (N400) and syntactic information (P600). Recent ERP studies have challenged this well-defined distinction by showing P600 effects for semantic and pragmatic anomalies. So far, it is still unresolved whether the P600 reflects specific or rather common processes. The present study addresses this question by investigating ERPs in response to a syntactic and pragmatic (irony) manipulation, as well as a combined syntactic and pragmatic manipulation. For the syntactic condition, a morphosyntactic violation was applied, whereas for the pragmatic condition, such as ‚ÄúThat is rich‚Äù, either an ironic or literal interpretation was achieved, depending on the prior context. The ERPs at the critical word showed a LAN-P600 pattern for syntactically incorrect sentences relative to correct ones. For ironic compared to literal sentences, ERPs showed a P200 effect followed by a P600 component. In comparison of the syntax-related P600 to the irony-related P600, distributional differences were found. Moreover, for the P600 time window (i.e., 500‚Äì900 ms), different changes in theta power between the syntax and pragmatics effects were found, suggesting that different patterns of neural activity contributed to each respective effect. Thus, both late positivities seem to be differently sensitive to these two types of linguistic information, and might reflect distinct neurocognitive processes, such as reanalysis of the sentence structure versus pragmatic reanalysis.},

	abstract = {Covertly directing visual attention toward a spatial location in the absence of visual stimulation enhances future visual processing at the attended position. The neuronal correlates of these attention shifts involve modulation of neuronal "baseline" activity in early visual areas, presumably through top-down control from higher-order attentional systems. We used electroencephalography to study the largely unknown relationship between these neuronal modulations and behavioral outcome in an attention orienting paradigm. Covert visuospatial attention shifts to either a left or right peripheral position in the absence of visual stimulation resulted in differential modulations of oscillatory alpha-band (8-14 Hz) activity over left versus right posterior sites. These changes were driven by varying degrees of alpha-decreases being maximal contralateral to the attended position. When expressed as a lateralization index, these alpha-changes differed significantly between attention conditions, with negative values (alpha\_right {\textless} alpha\_left) indexing leftward and more positive values (alpha\_left {\textless} or = alpha\_right) indexing rightward attention. Moreover, this index appeared deterministic for processing of forthcoming visual targets. Collapsed over trials, there was an advantage for left target processing in accordance with an overall negative bias in alpha-index values. Across trials, left targets were detected most rapidly when preceded by negative index values. Detection of right targets was fastest in trials with most positive values. Our data indicate that collateral modulations of posterior alpha-activity, the momentary bias of visuospatial attention, and imminent visual processing are linked. They suggest that the momentary direction of attention, predicting spatial biases in imminent visual processing, can be estimated from a lateralization index of posterior alpha-activity.},

At posterior parietal brain areas early components of the event-related potential (P1 and N1) were higher when the cue had been valid compared with invalid. An anticipatory attention effect was found in EEG alpha magnitude at parieto-occipital electrode sites. Starting 200 ms before target onset alpha amplitudes were significantly stronger suppressed at sites contralateral to the attended visual hemifield than ipsilateral to it. In addition, phase coupling between prefrontal and posterior parietal electrode sites was calculated. It was found that prefrontal cortex shows stronger phase coupling with posterior sites that are contralateral to the attended hemifield than ipsilateral sites. The results suggest that a shift of attention selectively modulates excitability of the contralateral posterior parietal cortex and that this posterior modulation of alpha activity is controlled by prefrontal regions.},

	abstract = {Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and theta band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good performance is related to two types of EEG phenomena (i) a tonic increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and (ii) a large phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance, this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned. It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases, whereas theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated with (semantic) long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information. The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations. It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected by theta oscillations in hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas search and retrieval processes in (semantic) long-term memory are reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops.},

During retrieval attempts theta behaves like a traveling wave spreading from anterior to posterior sites. During actual retrieval, however, evoked upper alpha becomes transiently nested in theta. We suggest that theta reflects working memory functions whereas upper alpha may be important for the reactivation of long-term memory codes in short-term memory.},

	abstract = {The traditional belief is that brain oscillations are important for human long-term memory, because they induce synchronized firing between cell assemblies which shapes synaptic plasticity. Therefore, most prior studies focused on the role of synchronization for episodic memory, as reflected in theta (‚àº5 Hz) and gamma ({\textgreater}40 Hz) power increases. These studies, however, neglect the role that is played by neural desynchronization, which is usually reflected in power decreases in the alpha and beta frequency band (8‚Äì30 Hz). In this paper we present a first idea, derived from information theory that gives a mechanistic explanation of how neural desynchronization aids human memory encoding and retrieval. Thereby we will review current studies investigating the role of alpha and beta power decreases during long-term memory tasks and show that alpha and beta power decreases play an important and active role for human memory. Applying mathematical models of information theory, we demonstrate that neural desynchronization is positively related to the richness of information represented in the brain, thereby enabling encoding and retrieval of long-term memories. This information via desynchronization hypothesis makes several predictions, which can be tested in future experiments.},

In this work, we examine how sentence-level syntactic unification operations are reflected in the oscillatory dynamics of the MEG. Participants read sentences that were either correct, contained a word category violation, or were constituted of random word sequences devoid of syntactic structure. A time‚Äìfrequency analysis of MEG power changes revealed three types of effects. The first type of effect was related to the detection of a (word category) violation in a syntactically structured sentence, and was found in the alpha and gamma frequency bands. A second type of effect was maximally sensitive to the syntactic manipulations: A linear increase in beta power across the sentence was present for correct sentences, was disrupted upon the occurrence of a word category violation, and was absent in syntactically unstructured random word sequences. We therefore relate this effect to syntactic unification operations. Thirdly, we observed a linear increase in theta power across the sentence for all syntactically structured sentences. The effects are tentatively related to the building of a working memory trace of the linguistic input. In conclusion, the data seem to suggest that syntactic unification is reflected by neuronal synchronization in the lower-beta frequency band.},

In this study we investigated the dynamics of semantic integration of visual and linguistic information by means of time-frequency analysis of the EEG signal. A modified version of the N400 paradigm with either a word or a picture of an object being semantically incongruous with respect to the preceding sentence context was employed. Event-Related Potential (ERP) analysis showed qualitatively similar N400 effects for integration of either word or picture. Time-frequency analysis revealed early specific decreases in alpha and gamma band power for linguistic and visual information respectively. We argue that these reflect a rapid context-based analysis of acoustic (word) or visual (picture) form information. We conclude that although full semantic integration of linguistic and visual information occurs through a common mechanism, early differences in oscillations in specific frequency bands reflect the format of the incoming information and, importantly, an early context-based detection of its congruity with respect to the preceding language context.},

The difference in alpha frequency between good and bad performers reaches a maximum during the retrieval of information, is much smaller during encoding and is minimal ‚Äî but still significant- during a resting period. These results suggest that alpha frequency may be a permanent and not only a functional parameter that determines the speed with which information can be retrieved from memory. The calculation of changes in band power indicate further that the upper alpha band is particularly sensitive to sematic memory demands. The lower alpha band, on the other hand, seems to reflect attentional processes. These findings are discussed on the basis of a hypothesis which assumes that EEG frequencies within the alpha band stem at least in part from the thalamus and that the activity of thalamo-cortical networks reflects processes that are related to searching, accessing and retrieving information from (somatic) long-term memory.¬© 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {This article tries to integrate results in memory research from divergent disciplines such as cognitive psychology, neuroanatomy, and neurophysiology. The integrating link is seen in more recent findings that provide strong arguments for the assumption that oscillations are a basic form of communication between cortical cell assemblies. It is assumed that synchronous oscillations of large cell assemblies--termed type 1 synchronization--reflect a resting state or possibly even a state of functional inhibition. On the other hand, during mental activity, when different neuronal networks may start to oscillate with different frequencies, each network may still oscillate synchronously (this is termed type 2 synchronization), but as a consequence, the large scale type 1 oscillation disappears. It is argued that these different types of synchronization can be observed in the scalp EEG by calculating event-related power changes within comparatively narrow but individually adjusted frequency bands. Experimental findings are discussed which support the hypothesis that short-term (episodic) memory demands lead to a synchronization (increase in band power) in the theta band, whereas long-term (semantic) memory demands lead to a task-specific desynchronization (decrease or suppression of power) in the upper alpha band. Based on these and other findings, a new memory model is proposed that is described on three levels: cognitive, anatomical and neurophysiological. It is suggested that short-term (episodic) memory processes are reflected by oscillations in an anterior limbic system, whereas long-term (semantic) memory processes are reflected by oscillations in a posterior-thalamic system. Oscillations in these frequency bands possibly provide the basis for encoding, accessing, and retrieving cortical codes that are stored in the form of widely distributed but intensely interconnected cell assemblies.},

Data from child simultaneous bilingual acquisition raises serious questions for the construct of incomplete acquisition, a term broadly used in heritage language acquisition studies to describe almost any difference heritage speakers display from baseline controls (usually monolinguals). We offer an epistemological discussion related to incomplete acquisition, highlighting the descriptive and theoretical inaccuracy of the term. We focus our discussion on two of several possible causal factors that contribute to variable competence outcomes in adult heritage speakers: input and formal instruction in the heritage language. We conclude by offering alternative terminology for heritage speaker outcomes.},

	abstract = {This dissertation is an analysis of the morphosyntax of the Turkish causative construction within the framework of Distributed Morphology (DM). It is an attempt to capture a range of different phenomena in a principled way within this framework. Important aspects of DM for the analysis herein include the syntactic derivation of words; the existence of an acategorial Root from which all words are syntactically derived; and the late (post-syntactic) insertion of Vocabulary Items (VIs) into terminal syntactic nodes.
A distinction is made between two different levels of causative: Root (or inner) causatives, and productive (or outer) causatives. Root causatives are minimal structures in which a Root phrase (comprising a Root and its nominal complement) is merged with a verbalizing head, little-v (Harley 1995; Chomsky 1995, 2001; Marantz 1997). This domain is the locus of idiosyncratic allomorphy, and it is where the traditionally recognized 'irregular' causatives suffixes are found. In addition, another type of idiosyncratic Root-adjacent phenomenon is identified in this study: independent exponence of the verbalizing feature and of the causative feature (CAUS). This is analyzed as CAUS fission: the result of a post-syntactic operation that splits the terminal node [v, CAUS] into two positions of exponence.
Productive causatives are larger structures in which a vP is merged with a CAUS head. The identification of the Root causative head as v.CAUS but the productive causative head as simply CAUS is a departure from Harley's (2008) analysis of Japanese causatives, and is a new proposal in this work. Following Pylkk√§nen (2002, 2008), the external argument is not introduced by either v.CAUS or CAUS, but by a higher projection, Voice. This innovation makes it possible to model syntactic differences between Japanese and Turkish productive causatives. Japanese causatives embed Voice (i.e., they are 'phase-selecting,' in Pylkk√§nen's terminology) while Turkish causatives embed little-v (i.e., they are 'verb-selecting'). Hence, the former behave as two clauses with regard to a range of diagnostics, while the latter behave as a single clause. Furthermore, it is proposed that productive causatives do not exhibit syntactic recursion, and that cases of causative iteration are actually morphological reduplication.},

However, little research has tested delayed effects of learning under an incidental condition or moved beyond word order. This study investigated learning of third language (L3) morphosyntax (word order and case marking) under an incidental exposure condition. Participants were second language Spanish learners exposed auditorily to a semiartificial language, Japlish, during a semantic plausibility judgment task. Performance following exposure to L3 Japlish was assessed with acceptability judgment and picture-matching tasks that were administered immediately after exposure and 2 weeks later. Results on immediate tests showed a significant learning effect on acceptability judgment but none for picture matching. At delayed testing, results showed maintenance of the learning effect on acceptability judgment and significantly improved performance on picture matching. Results additionally showed that many of the learners arrived at the correct Japlish word-order rule; fewer did so for case marking. Follow-up analyses indicated that this rule knowledge, as measured by debriefing information, was important for performance on both assessment tasks, particularly at delayed testing. The results suggest that learning of L3 structures can take place following incidental exposure, that such learning is durable and undergoes improvement, and that development of reportable rule knowledge may also play an important role.},

Many studies in this paradigm have demonstrated that learners exposed to strings of letters that conform to the grammar come to know, in a very short time, complex constraints on how they can be sequenced, without being able to verbalize this knowledge. This article summarizes results of a study (Robinson, 2002, 2005) that compared learning of an Artificial Grammar, by experienced second language learners, with their learning of a novel natural second language, Samoan. Implications are drawn from this comparison concerning the extent to which inferences about the earliest stages of natural second language acquisition can be drawn from the many studies of Artificial Grammar learning that have been done in the broader field of cognitive psychology.},

A growing body of empirical evidence suggests that the mechanisms involved in artificial language learning and in structured sequence processing are shared with those of natural language acquisition and natural language processing. Finally, by theoretically analyzing a formal learning model, we highlight Fodor's insight that it is logically possible to combine innate, domain-specific constraints with domain-general learning mechanisms.},

Ellis, 2002) has identified how language users are sensitive to the frequency of language forms and their sequential probabilities at all levels of granularity from phoneme to phrase. This knowledge allows efficient language processing and underpins acquisition by syntactic bootstrapping. Research on explicit learning (e.g., N. C. Ellis, 2005) has shown how conscious processing promotes the acquisition of novel explicit cross-modal form-meaning associations. These breathe meaning into the processing of language form and they underpin acquisition by semantic bootstrapping. This is particularly important in establishing novel processing routines in L2 acquisition. These representations are also then available as units of implicit learning in subsequent processing. Language systems emerge, both diachronically and ontogenetically, from the statistical abstraction of patterns latent within and across form and function in language usage. The complex adaptive system (N. C. Ellis \& Larsen-Freeman, 2009b) of interactions within AND across form and function is far richer than that emergent from implicit or explicit learning alone.},

We claim that these two ways of assigning case are complementary, based on data from the Turkic language Sakha. Accusative case and dative case in this language are assigned by Marantz-style conÔ¨Ågurational rules that do not refer directly to functional categories. This is shown by evidence from passives, agentive nominalizations, subject raising, possessor raising, and case assignment in PPs. In contrast, there is evidence that nominative and genitive are assigned by functional heads in the Chomskyan way, as shown by the distribution of nominative case and the relationship between case marking and agreement. The two methods of case assignment thus coexist, not only in Universal Grammar, but even in the grammar of a single language.},

I propose that the former is formed by a derivation in which the verb moves as far as a functional head such Aspect or Modal, creating a participle. A verbal feature (copula) is inserted at To satisfying its verbal requirement. In the latter case the verb moves all the way up to To. No copula is inserted.},

	abstract = {This experimental study investigates the relationship between lexical semantics and derivational morphology in the acquisition of causative/inchoative-related verbs in Turkish as a second language (L2) by Spanish and English speakers. Results of a picture judgment task show that although L2 learners have largely acquired the correct lexico-syntactic classification of verbs in Turkish, they were constrained by the morphological patterns of their first language (L1) when learning derivational morphology, especially with causative/inchoative verbs. Results also show failure to reject transitivity errors and inappropriate derivational morphology with unaccusative, unergative, and noncausative/inchoative transitive verbs. The transitivity errors documented are analogous to the overgeneralization errors reported in the L1 and L2 acquisition literature of English and other languages. It is suggested that L2 learners incorrectly adopt the lexico-syntactic representation of change-of-state verbs (the semantic template of an accomplishment) when they are not clear about the event-type classification of a particular verb. In this study, I also suggest that L2 learners are atuned to the rich morphology of Turkish and that the acquisition of derivational morphology and lexical semantics are not dissociated in these interlanguage grammars.},

	shorttitle = {The case of the direct object in {Turkish}},
	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the interaction between semantic parameters and morphological constraints in determining the distribution of the accusative case marker-(y)I in Turkish. This marker is often discussed as an instance of differentiated object marking (DOM). The account of accusative marking based on a functional interpretation of DOM assumes that the case suffix marks a direct object if it is too similar to an archetypical subject. Other approaches to accusative marking in Turkish have been based on the observation that the accusative marker is closely related to the direct object‚Äôs specificity as such, rather than to the similarity of the direct object to a typical subject‚Äîand there is general agreement that typical subjects are specific. These approaches predict that specific subjects are also overtly case-marked; this is confirmed by the data. Enc (1991) explains specificity in terms of partitivity and argues that the accusative case marker indicates a partitive construction (or at least an implied partitive relation), and thus marks a specific direct object. In this paper we show that the conditions for the distribution of this case marker are quite complex and cannot be explained within the functional view of DOM. In particular, we argue that the suffix indicates specificity under certain morpho-syntactic conditions, rather than indicating just a contrast to the subject. This view is vindicated by the assignment of (genitive) case to the embedded subject that is determined by very similar morpho-syntactic and semantic conditions: the embedded subject receives genitive case if it is specific and no genitive case if it is non-specific. Furthermore we show that Enc‚Äôs definition of specificity in terms of partitivity must be modified for semantic as well as morphological reasons. We develop a more flexible notion of specificity in terms of referentially anchored indefinite NPs. We give additional evidence, based on the detailed analysis of the morphological conditions for partitives, which shows that partitives are not necessarily specific. In conclusion, we show that the accusative case marker can indicate the referential property of the direct object (such as specificity) in clearly defined morphological environments in a reliable fashion; in other contexts, it is not a reliable indicator of properties like specificity.},

	abstract = {ing away from the Case licensing positions, (13) would be a rough representation of the VP embeddings of a sentence like Alice made Bill make Don eat some cabbage at D-sttucture. Without any locality requirement on Patient association, arguments inside the lowest VP in (13), DP3 and DP4, would be able to associate with the Patient of CAUSEl' just as the XP complement of the lower V would with the Patient of CAUSE in (10). Thus, a relatively straightforward structure like (13) would yield numerous combinations of Patient association that are not attested. For example, (9) The object does not associate with a role across the XP boundary in all instances of the resultative construction. Unergative verbs like laugh also take resultative objects, as in (i), but they do not provide any thematic role for them, just as they do not provide any role for their cognate objects, as seen in (ri). (D We laughed Bill out of the room (li) Sue laughed a hearty laugh (10) Originally defined by Rozwadowska (1988), Neutral is the unaffected version of the traditional Patient role. (11) It would be reasonable to speculate that the same procedure is operative in the serial verb construction and the Larsonian double-layered VP structures with three-place predicates like give. The latter case is presented and argued for in Kural (1996). VERB INCORPORATION AND CAUSATION TYPES 237 DP3 would be able to associate with the Patient of CAUSE2, and DP4 with the Patient of CAUSEl' which would be describing an event where Bill acts on Don, Alice acts on the cabbage, and Don eats some cabbage as a result, e.g., Bill forcing Don to eat the cabbage while Alice is cutting it up in little pieces. However, this is not an interpretation one can plausibly ascribe to A/ice made Bill make Don eat some cabbage. The kind of locality needed to block such unwanted readings is a familiar type of minimality condition reminiscent of Aoun's (1985) Generalized Binding, Rizzi's (1990) Relativized Minimality, and Chomsky's (1991) Economy Principles. (14) The Intervention Effect: An XP may not associate with a thematic role R provided by a predicate P if there is a yP such that Pc-commands YP, and yP c-commands XP. According to (14), an argument cannot associate with the Patient of CAUSE across another argument position, which means only the highest specifier position is accessible for this Patient role. Since it prevents the internal argument of a V from associating with the Patient of CAUSE, it also effectively eliminates Alsina's (1992) derivation for circumstantial causation, i.e., the reading of Alice made Don eat some cabbage in which Alice only creates the circumstances for Don's cabbage eating, perhaps by eating everything else in the refrigerator or by placing the cabbage in his favorite meal. The specifier Don intervenes between the object of the lower VP, some cabbage, and CAUSE. However, there is a much closer target for the Patient role that is not excluded by (14), and that is the root node of the entire complement VP. After all, it is the internal argument of CAUSE, and therefore, a natural candidate to associate with the Patient role. This VP contains all the relevant components of the caused event, i.e., the arguments and the predicate, so it encompasses the event as a whole, which is what is being affected in this reading. When aVP becomes the Patient of CAUSE, it is interpreted as the causer creating the caused event by manipulating the circumstances, without interacting with any participant of the caused event. The following is a schematized diagram of the D-Structure thematic relations under the circumstantial interpretation.},

@inproceedings{goksel_levels_1993,
	title = {Levels of representation and argument structure in {Turkish}.},
	abstract = {This is a study of the argument structure of complex predicates in Turkish. The central hypothesis is that grammatical function changing phenomena such as morphological causativisation, passivisation and reflexivisation exhibit the interaction of processes of grammar and general reasoning. The work aims at explaining the properties of these constructions in the newly emerging framework of Labelled Deductive Systems (Gabbay 1990, Gabbay and Kempson 1992a,b), a model which articulates grammar as a natural deductive system. Part I provides the theoretical background for the analysis of complex predicates. The first chapter introduces the issues surrounding the representation of complex predicates and argues against a particular multi-stratal approach, syntactic incorporation. In the second chapter complex predicates are investigated within Licensing Grammar, a two-level syntactic model. It is argued that although this model accounts for certain asymmetries by virtue of characterising syntax and logic separately, its commitment to a static understanding of logic undermines its explanatory capacity. The third chapter lays out the properties of the model which is used in the remainder of the dissertation. The framework of LDS characterises linguistic phenomena as a process whereby instructions provided by lexical specifications dynamically interact, and syntactic structures unfold as these specifications are implemented. Part II is an analysis of causativisation, passivisation and reflexivisation in Turkish. It is argued that causativisation involves an altogether different mechanism from passivisation and reflexivisation. The causative affix in Turkish has declarative content and behaves like a predicate, whereas passivisation and reflexivisation are instructions operating on the argument structure of verbs. Chapter IV focuses on causativisation. It is shown that LDS, with its procedural apparatus, captures the problems surrounding the clausal nature of causativisation quite naturally. It is also argued that case marking in causative constructions, a previously problematic issue, receives a straightforward explanation once case marking is taken to give instructions for structure building in the combinatorial process. In Chapter V I propose a unitary account for passives and reflexives in Turkish. I suggest that both involve argument absorption defined through a notion of logical dependency, the difference between them being stated in terms of the argument to be absorbed. The interaction of these processes with case marking is analysed and the analysis of case marking is shown to make correct predictions. In Chapter VI the proposed analysis is extended to combinations of causatives, passives and reflexives and their interaction with case marking. We see that separating causativisation as a process which is radically distinct from the other two is justified and that the proposed properties of case marking are verified. Some sequences which remain problematic for all analyses are also discussed. The final chapter discusses the status of certain concepts and principles of Universal Grammar (the Projection Principle, Theta Theory, Case Theory, the Mirror Principle) in the light of the newly emerging model of LDS. With respect to configurationality, I argue that hierarchy and linearity need to be characterised separately, a possibility which is available in the framework of LDS.},

A fine structural analysis of subject, object, and reflexive clitics suggests that whereas the object clitic chain crosses the subject chain, the reflexive clitic chain is nested within it. We argue that this structural difference introduces differences in processing complexity, chain crossing being more complex than nesting. In support of this analysis, both production and comprehension experiments show that children have more difficulty with object than with reflexive clitics (with more omissions in production and more erroneous judgments in sentences involving Principle B in comprehension). Concerning the morphological aspect, French subject and object pronouns agree in gender with their referent. We report serious difficulties with pronoun gender both in production and comprehension in children around the age of 4 (with nearly 30\% errors in production and chance level judgments in comprehension), which tend to disappear by age 6. The distribution of errors further suggests that the masculine gender is processed as the default value. These findings provide further insights into the relationship between comprehension and production in the acquisition process.},

We address the following research questions: Do both languages contribute to crosslinguistic influence in third language acquisition, or is one of them chosen as the sole source of influence? Is crosslinguistic influence always from the typologically more similar language? Is crosslinguistic influence always facilitative, or can it also be non-facilitative?Methodology:The paper reports on a grammaticality judgment task with two word order conditions, both related to verb movement (verb-second in Norwegian and subject-auxiliary inversion in English).Data and Analysis:An experiment was carried out with three groups of 11-14-year-old participants, Norwegian-Russian bilinguals (n=22), Norwegian-speaking monolinguals (n=46), and Russian-speaking monolinguals (n=31). The data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed effects logistic regression allowing us to estimate the effects of condition (Adv-V, Aux-S), language (Norwegian, Norwegian-Russian, Russian) and their interaction on the correctness of judgments.Findings:The analysis reveals that while L1 Norwegian children over-accept ungrammatical sentences in English with a word order that reflects verb movement (V2), bilingual Norwegian-Russian children notice these errors significantly more often, just like L1 Russians. At the same time, the bilinguals score lower than L1 Russian children on grammatical trials, suggesting the presence of non-facilitative influence from Norwegian.Originality:This study argues for the Linguistic Proximity Model, which proposes incremental property-by-property learning and allows for both facilitative and non-facilitative influence from one or both of the previously acquired languages.Significance:The Linguistic Proximity Model and supporting experimental data contribute to existing models in third language acquisition by indicating that not just typological proximity but also structural similarity at an abstract level should be considered an important factor in third language acquisition.},

Developmental relations between form and function will be studied across a broad range of functional categories, such as temporality, perspective, connectivity, and narrative coherence. Moreover, a variety of language contact situations is considered with broad variation in the typological distances between the languages in order to enable cross-linguistic comparison. The analysis of learner data in various cross-linguistic settings may thus offer new information on the role of the structural properties of unrelated languages on the process of narrative acquisition.

	abstract = {This article presents studies of Hindi that investigate whether responses to syntactic agreement violations vary as a function of the type and number of incorrect agreement features, using both electrophysiological (ERP) and behavioral measures. Hindi is well suited to investigation of this issue, since verbs in Hindi mark agreement with the person, number, and gender features of the nominative subject noun phrase. In an ERP study evoked responses were recorded for visually presented verbs appearing at the end of a sentence-initial adverbial clause, comparing responses in a grammatically correct condition with four grammatically incorrect conditions that mismatched the correct agreement on different dimensions (Gender, Number, Gender/Number, Person/Gender). A P600 response was elicited in all grammatically incorrect conditions. No amplitude differences were found among the Gender, Number, and combined Gender/Number violations. This suggests that the feature distance between observed and expected word forms at the morphosyntactic level does not impact ERP responses, contrasting with findings on semantic and auditory processing, and suggests that the P600 response to agreement violations is not additive based on the number of mismatching features and does not reflect top-down, predictive mechanisms. A significantly larger P600 response was elicited by the combined Person/Gender violation, and two different violations involving the Person feature were judged as more severe and recognized more quickly in the behavioral studies. This effect is attributed to the greater salience of the Person feature at multiple levels of representation.},

	abstract = {In the domain of written sentence comprehension, the computation of agreement dependencies is generally considered as a form-driven processing routine whose domain is syntactic in nature. In the present review we discuss the main findings emerging in the Event-Related Potential (ERP) literature on sentence comprehension, focusing on the different dimensions of agreement patterns (features, values, constituents involved and language): Agreement mismatches usually evoke a biphasic electrophysiological pattern (Left Anterior Negativity ‚Äì LAN, 300‚Äì450msec and P600 after 500msec). This ERP pattern is assumed to reflect rule-based computations sensitive to formal (inflectional) covariations of related words (trigger‚Äìtarget). Here we claim that agreement processing is sensitive to both the type of feature involved and the constituents that express the agreement dependency. More specifically, LAN could reflect violation of expectancy (elicited by the trigger) for the target functional morphology; later, trigger and target are structurally integrated at the sentence level (earlyP600). However, morphosyntactic information could trigger the activation of higher-level representations that are not strictly syntactic in nature. The recruitment of this additional non-syntactic information (mirrored by N400-like effects) indicates that rule-based computations of agreement dependencies are not blind to non-syntactic information but are often recruited to establish sentence-level relations.},

Linear distance did not affect integration and diagnosis or revision processes at the verb, as indexed by early negative and P600 components. This is in accordance with hierarchy-based models of reanalysis, but is problematic for distance-based integration models. However, tracking of the subject features is affected by linear factors: more judgment errors were made in the long compared to the short condition. Furthermore, the presence of a plural object between the singular subject and the verb led to more judgment errors, and an enhanced positivity around 250 ms for the grammatical verbs. This suggests that linear factors affect feature tracking, but not integration processes following feature retrieval or repair processes following the detection of a mismatch.},

First-pass reading time was found to be longer for incongruent predicates than of congruent predicates but only if the predicate's gender was morphologically marked. Furthermore, this effect was larger in the animate than in the inanimate condition. Second-pass reading time was also prolonged by gender incongruity but this effect was not affected by either markedness or animacy. Gender incongruity enhanced the amplitude of an early negative potential (ostensibly ELAN), of a later negative potential (N400), and of a positive potential (P600). Like first-pass reading time, the congruity effect on the syntactically modulated P600 was significant only for marked predicates, but it did not interact with animacy. In contrast, the congruity effect on the semantically modulated N400 was significant only in the animate condition. The N400 was not affected by markedness. The congruity effect on the early negativity did not interact with either animacy or markedness. The interaction between semantic and syntactic processing and its time course are discussed within the framework set by interactive, constraint-based models for online sentence processing.},

We tested first exposure in L3/Ln using two artificial languages (ALs) lexically based in English and Spanish, focusing on gender agreement between determiners and nouns, and between nouns and adjectives. 50 L1 Spanish-L2 English speakers took part in the experiment. After receiving implicit training in one of the ALs (Mini-Spanish, N¬†=¬†26; Mini-English, N¬†=¬†24), gender violations elicited a fronto-lateral negativity in Mini-English in the earliest time window (200‚Äì500¬†ms), although this was not followed by any other differences in subsequent periods. This effect was highly localized, surfacing only in electrodes of the right-anterior region. In contrast, gender violations in Mini-Spanish elicited a broadly distributed positivity in the 300‚Äì600¬†ms time window. While we do not find typical indices of grammatical processing such as the P600 component, we believe that the between-groups differential appearance of the positivity for gender violations in the 300‚Äì600¬†ms time window reflects differential allocation of attentional resources as a function of the ALs‚Äô lexical similarity to English or Spanish. We take these differences in attention to be precursors of the processes involved in transfer source selection in L3/Ln.},

	abstract = {In this article, I argue that first language (L1), second language (L2) and third language (L3) acquisition are fundamentally the same process, based on learning by parsing. Both child and adult learners are sensitive to fine linguistic distinctions, and language development takes place in small steps. While the bulk of the article focuses on crosslinguistic influence in L2/Ln acquisition, I first briefly outline the Micro-cue Model of L1 acquisition (Westergaard, 2009a, 2014), arguing that children build their I-language grammars incrementally, paying attention to small distinctions in syntax and information structure from early on. They are also shown to be conservative learners, generally not producing overt elements or performing movement operations unless there is positive evidence for this in the input, thus minimizing the need for unlearning. I then ask the question how this model fares with respect to multilingual situations, more specifically L2 and L3 acquisition. Discussing both theoretical and empirical evidence, I argue that, although L2 and L3 learners are different from L1 children in that they are not always conservative learners, they are also sensitive to fine linguistic distinctions, in that transfer/crosslinguistic influence takes place on a property-by-property basis. Full Transfer is traditionally understood as wholesale transfer at the initial state of L2 acquisition. However, I argue that it is impossible to distinguish between wholesale and property-by-property transfer in L2 acquisition on empirical grounds. In L3 acquisition, on the other hand, crosslinguistic influence from both previously acquired languages would provide support for property-by-property transfer. I discuss a few such cases and argue for what I call Full Transfer Potential (FTP), rather than Full (wholesale) Transfer, within the Linguistic Proximity Model (LPM) of L3 acquisition. Thus, rather than assuming that ‚Äòeverything does transfer‚Äô, I argue that ‚Äòanything may transfer‚Äô.},

The TPM maintains that structural proximity between the L3 and the L1 and/or the L2 determines L3 transfer. In addition to demonstrating empirical support for the TPM, this article articulates a proposal for how the mind unconsciously determines typological (structural) proximity based on linguistic cues from the L3 input stream used by the parser early on to determine holistic transfer of one previous (the L1 or the L2) system. This articulated version of the TPM is motivated by argumentation appealing to cognitive and linguistic factors. Finally, in line with the general tenets of the TPM, I ponder if and why L3 transfer might obtain differently depending on the type of bilingual (e.g. early vs. late) and proficiency level of bilingualism involved in the L3 process.},

One possible source of discrepancy in the evidence may be that bilingualism tends to be treated as a monolithic category distinct from monolingualism. We address this possibility by examining the effects of different bilingual language experiences on brain activity related to EC performance. Participants were scanned (fMRI) while they performed a Flanker task. Behavioral data showed robust Flanker effects, not modulated by language experiences across participants. However, differences in duration of bilingual experience and extent of active language use predicted activation in distinct brain regions indicating differences in neural recruitment across conditions. This approach highlights the need to consider specific bilingual language experiences in assessing neurocognitive effects. It further underscores the utility and complementarity of neuroimaging evidence in this general line of research, contributing to a deeper understanding of the variability reported in the literature.},

Six self-paced reading experiments examined the online mechanisms underlying the analogous attraction effects that have been shown in comprehension; namely reduced disruption for subject‚Äìverb agreement violations when these ‚Äòattractor‚Äô nouns intervene. One class of theories suggests that these effects are rooted in faulty representation of the number of the subject, while another class of theories suggests instead that such effects arise in the process of re-accessing subject number at the verb. Two main findings provide evidence against the first class of theories. First, attraction also occurs in relative clause configurations in which the attractor noun does not intervene between subject and verb and is not in a direct structural relationship with the subject head (e.g., ‚ÄòThe drivers who the runner wave to each morning‚Äô). Second, we observe a ‚Äògrammatical asymmetry‚Äô: attraction effects are limited to ungrammatical sentences, which would be unexpected if the representation of subject number were inherently prone to error. We argue that agreement attraction in comprehension instead reflects a cue-based retrieval mechanism that is subject to retrieval errors. The grammatical asymmetry can be accounted for under one implementation that we propose, or if the mechanism is only called upon when the predicted agreement features fail to be instantiated on the verb.},

	abstract = {This chapter contextualizes the methodological landscape of formal linguistic heritage language studies, with a special emphasis on emerging, innovative trends. The chapter is divided in three parts. Part 1 reviews methodological challenges related to testing heritage speaker knowledge (e.g., modality of testing, issues pertaining to baselines) as well as the history of offline behavioral experimentation that typically compares heritage speakers to monolingual baselines (Montrul 2008, 2016; Polinsky, 2018). We will seek to take stock of what has been robustly studied to date versus where there is welcomed room for further investigation in the near future (e.g. the imbalance between heritage speaker developmental studies in young and older aged children and adolescents versus the highly studied case of competence outcomes in (young) adult ultimate attainment, e.g. Kupisch \& Rothman, 2016). Part 2 considers recent trends in heritage language empirical studies adopting online methods (e.g., Villegas, 2014; Kim, Montrul \& Yoon, 2015; Jacob, ≈ûafak, Demir, Kƒ±rkƒ±cƒ±, 2018), contributing both complementary evidence to the considerably larger behavioral data base that dominates the field as well as some challenges for claims made on this basis of behavioral data alone. Part 3 unpacks the emerging trend focusing on the continuum of differences within heritage speakers themselves, attempting to quantify, reveal and understand correlations of individual experiences (using regression statistical analyses) with access to and engagement with input as well as opportunities for converting input to intake that might shed light on how and why individual grammars take the developmental path and end state they do (Bayram et al., 2017; Lloyd-Smith et al., under review).},

In a series of three experiments, we tested the effects of three variables on the number of subject-verb agreement errors. Like Bock and Miller, we found that mismatching singular and plural features between the subject head noun and a local noun in a complex NP increased the number of errors. It was also found that ambiguous morphophonological marking on the subject noun increased errors. The most striking result was that the preferred interpretation of the complex NP had a significant influence. Singular heads, normally taken to denote several tokens, such as the label on the bottles, tend to induce incorrect plural verb completions. This is in contrast to the findings for English speakers and raises the question as to whether the construction of subject-verb agreement is a purely syntactic process in all languages. A modified version of a model of syntactic encoding (Kempen \& Hoenkamp, 1987) is proposed that can satisfactorily deal with the number mismatching effect and crucially the presence/absence of semantic effects on verbal agreement in different languages.},

That is, one member of the opposition (e.g. feminine for gender, plural for number) is assumed to be marked, and the other one, unmarked. The present study examines how these asymmetries impact agreement resolution in Spanish. Agreement was manipulated between a noun acting as head of a relative clause and an adjective located inside the relative clause (e.g. catedral que parec√≠a inmensa ‚Äúcathedral that looked huge‚Äù). Half of the nouns were feminine (marked) and the other half, masculine (unmarked). Half of the nouns were used in the plural (marked) and the other half, in the singular (unmarked). Twentyseven Spanish native speakers read 240 sentences while their brain activity was recorded with electroencephalography and performed a grammaticality judgment. Results showed that both number and gender violations elicited a central-posterior P600, a component associated with syntactic repair, and a late anterior negativity, argued to reflect working memory costs. Only the P600 was affected by markedness. It started earlier for violations where the mismatching feature was marked. Moreover, it was larger for errors where the mismatching feature was marked, although this amplitude modulation only emerged for number, possibly due to differences in how number and gender cues were realized (i.e. both masculine and feminine showed overt inflection, but singular was uninflected relative to plural). These results suggest that the parser is sensitive to markedness asymmetries in the course of online processing.},

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {Previous work on agreement computation in sentence comprehension motivates a model in which the parser predicts the verb‚Äôs number and engages in retrieval of the agreement controller only when it detects a mismatch between the prediction and the bottom-up input. It is the error-driven second stage of this process that is prone to similarity-based interference and can result in the illusory licensing of a subject‚Äìverb number agreement violation in the presence of a structurally irrelevant noun matching the number marking on the verb (‚ÄòThe bed by the lamps were. . .‚Äô), giving rise to an effect known as ‚Äòagreement attraction‚Äô. Here we ask to what extent the error-driven retrieval process underlying the illusory licensing alters the structural and thematic representation of the sentence. We use a novel dual-task paradigm that combines self-paced reading with a speeded forced choice task to investigate whether agreement attraction leads comprehenders to erroneously interpret the attractor as the thematic subject, which would indicate structural reanalysis. Participants read sentence fragments (‚ÄòThe bed by the lamp/lamps was/were undoubtedly quite‚Äô) and completed the sentences by choosing between two adjectives (‚Äòcomfortable‚Äô/‚Äôbright‚Äô) which were either compatible with the subject‚Äôs head noun or with the attractor. We found the expected agreement attraction proÔ¨Åle in the self-paced reading data but the interpretive error occurs on only a small subset of attraction trials, suggesting that in agreement attraction agreement checking rarely matches the thematic relation. We propose that illusory licensing of an agreement violation often reÔ¨Çects a low-level rechecking process that is only concerned with number and does not have an impact on the structural representation of the sentence. Interestingly, this suggests that error-driven repair processes can result in a globally inconsistent Ô¨Ånal sentence representation with a persistent mismatch between the subject and the verb.},

First we discuss this integration hypothesis in terms of a sentence processing model proposed elsewhere. Next, in Experiment 1, we show that the P600 is elicited in grammatical, non-garden path sentences in which integration is more difcult (i.e., ‚Äò‚Äòwho‚Äô ‚Äô questions) relative to a control sentence (‚Äò‚Äòwhether‚Äô‚Äô questions). This effect is replicated in Experiment 2. Furthermore, we directly compare the effect of difcult integration in grammatical sentences to the effect of agreement violations.

Yet these two systems must come together in the creation of a whole linguistic system in the mind of an individual. This book is designed to state the implications of these two paradigms in as clear a way as possible through examples of the research carried out within each paradigm and to examine how they can be made to inter-relate in a way which would enable us to explain better the overall process of SLA.},

section presents early ERP studies supporting the CPH, discusses some of their methodological problems, and follows up with
data from more recent studies avoiding these problems. It is concluded that well-controlled ERP studies support the convergence
hypothesis, according to which L2 learners initially differ from native speakers and then converge on native-like neurocognitive
processing mechanisms. The fact that ERPs in late L2 learners at high levels of proficiency are often indistinguishable from
those of native speakers suggests that age-of-acquisition effects in SLA are not primarily driven by maturational constraints.},

The present study compared 27 monolingual Dutch and 27 bilingual Turkish-Dutch children matched on age and fluid intelligence on their performance in a nonverbal switching task. Within the group of bilinguals, the relationship between nonverbal switching and language switching was examined. The results revealed no between-group differences on nonverbal switching. Within the bilingual sample, response times in the language switching and nonverbal switching tasks were related, although no relationships were found between accuracy, switch cost and mixing cost on both tasks. The results support the hypothesis that children utilize domain-general cognitive control in language switching, but this relationship does not entail that bilinguals have better cognitive control than monolinguals.},

	abstract = {In the present communication-based society, no natural language seems to have been left untouched by the trends of code-mixing. For different communicative purposes, a language uses linguistic codes from other languages. This gives rise to a mixed language which is neither totally the host language nor the foreign language. The mixed language poses a new challenge to the problem of machine translation. It is necessary to identify the ‚Äúforeign‚Äù elements in the source language and process them accordingly. The foreign elements may not appear in their original form and may get morphologically transformed as per the host language. Further, in a complex sentence, a clause/utterance may be in the host language while another clause/utterance may be in the foreign language. Code-mixing of Hindi and English where Hindi is the host language, is a common phenomenon in day-to-day language usage in Indian metropolis. The scenario is so common that people have started considering this a different variety altogether and calling it by the name Hinglish. In this paper, we present a mechanism for machine translation of Hinglish to pure (standard) Hindi and pure English forms.},

	abstract = {In India, language is the key instrument by which we assimilate the culture. And it is a major means of identifying a set of people, nation or country. Hinglish, a portmanteau of ‚ÄúHindi‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù, is a hybrid of English and South Asian languages. It is a code-switching and mixing variety of these languages whereby they are freely interchanged within a sentence or between sentences. In a multilingual country like India code-mixing and switching has become a norm rather than a deviation. It is also noticed that linguists use the term code-mixing and switching interchangeably, especially in case of formal studies on syntax andmorphology. Language contact is considered to be an important phenomenon, especially in a multilingual society like India. While the name is based on the Hindi language, it does not refer exclusively to Hindi, but is used in India, with English words blending with Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi. With the advent of modern technology, and the availability of popular media in finger tips, from a toddler to a nonagenerian, the very concept of language, culture and communication has undergone a huge change. Hinglish and code-mixing and switching has crept its way into advertisements, TV shows, and Bollywood movies as well as the corridors of corporate and political power in India. This paper is an empirical study of code mixed and switched utterances in the form of songs, ad taglines and jingles in Indian media which came into existence as a by product of modern technology and changed the definition of communication in Indian media. And this paper further discusses the scope of Hinglish as the lingua franca for not only the upper-class urban Indians, but also semi-urban and rural centers of the Hindi-speaking states of India where modern technology in the form of television, radio, mobile phones, internet (social networking sites) etc. has become an indispensable part of their life.},

We take an ecological and sociolinguistic approach, depicting tensions between multilingualism and English across three national cases, at both policy and classroom level. Despite India's egalitarian Three Language Formula (TLF) of 1968, many Indian children are being educated in a language which is not their mother tongue. Singapore's bilingual education policy with English medium of instruction and mother tongues taught as second languages nevertheless leaves the linguistic capital of multilingual children who speak a pidginized variety of English called ‚ÄòSinglish‚Äô out of the equation, since the school medium is standard English. South Africa's Constitution of 1993 embraces multilingualism as a national resource, raising nine major African languages to national official status alongside English and Afrikaans, yet with the freedom of movement accompanying the dismantling of apartheid, large numbers of African language‚Äêspeaking parents seek to place their children in English‚Äêmedium instructional contexts. Given the push for English and simultaneous official valuing of multilingualism in all three cases, we briefly consider illustrative classroom examples and argue that multilingual classroom practices can be a resource through which children access Standard English while also cultivating their own local languages.},

It is suggested that the situation in which Indian English finds itself today could be seen as a stable, productive steady state in the evolutionary process in which there is an equilibrium between conflicting forces of progression and conservativism. This steady state in the diachronic development is linked to the synchronic view of present-day Indian English as a semiautonomous variety, which is characterized by three major determinants: common core, interference, and autonomy.},

How did this popular form of urban communication evolve? Is this language the new and trendy idiom of a youthful population no longer competent in either English or Hindi? Or is it an Indianized version of a once-colonial language, claiming its legitimate place alongside India's many bhashas? Chutnefying English: The Phenomenon of Hinglish, the first book on the subject, takes a serious look at this widespread phenomenon of our times which has pervaded every aspect of our daily lives. It addresses the questions that many speakers of both languages ask time and again: should Hinglish be spurned as the bastard offspring of its two parent languages, or welcomed as the natural and legitimate result of their long-term cohabitation?

India, with a 125 million English speakers boasts the second largest number of English speakers in the world, after the United States. The 1961‚Äì2001 Indian censuses report a sharp increase in Hindi/English Bilinguals, suggesting that English is on the rise in India. To the contrary, we claim supported by field evidence, that these statistics are inaccurate, ignoring an emerging class who do not have full bilingual competence and switch between Hindi and English, communicating via a code popularly known as ‚ÄúHinglish‚Äù. Since current language competition models occlude hybrid practices and detailed local ecological factors, they are inappropriate to capture the current language dynamics in India. Expanding predator‚Äìprey and sociolinguistic theories, we draw on local Indian ecological factors to develop a novel three-species model of interaction between Monolingual Hindi speakers, Hindi/English Bilinguals and Hinglish speakers, and explore the long time dynamics it predicts. The model also exhibits Turing instability, which is the first pattern formation result in language dynamics. These results challenge traditional assumptions of English encroachment in India. More broadly, the three-species model introduced here is a first step towards modeling the dynamics of hybrid language scenarios in other settings across the world.

Other early categorizations emphasized the global, national or regional outreach of varieties (in ‚Äúhub-and-spoke‚Äù models) or variety types based on sociolinguistic settings in communities and their resulting linguistic properties. In contrast, recent models emphasize the evolutionary or even cyclic character of varieties; these include Trudgill‚Äôs deterministic theory and, very widely accepted nowadays, Schneider‚Äôs Dynamic Model, which is broadly outlined, including a brief discussion of some applications of and reactions to it.},

Two constructions are investigated that do not match in English and Norwegian: One involving functional morphology, subject?verb (SV) agreement, which is obligatory in the L2 but non-existent in the first language (L1), and one involving syntax, verb-second (V2) word order, which is obligatory in the L1, but restricted to specific contexts in the L2. The results of an acceptability judgement task indicate that the participants struggled more with identifying ungrammatical SV agreement than ungrammatical word order.

	abstract = {Bacteria play a key role in sustaining the chemodiversity of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM), yet there is limited direct evidence of a major contribution of bacterial exometabolites to the DOM pool. This study tests whether molecular formulae of intact exometabolites can be detected in natural DOM via untargeted Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). We analyzed a series of quantitative mixtures of solid-phase extracted DOM from the deep ocean, of a natural microbial community and selected model strains of marine bacteria. Under standard instrument settings (200 broadband scans, mass range 92‚Äì1000 Da), 77\% of molecular formulae were shared between the mesocosm and marine DOM. However, there was {\textless} 10\% overlap between pure bacterial exometabolome with marine DOM, and in mixing ratios closest to mimicking natural environments (1\% bacterial DOM, 99\% marine DOM), only 4\% of the unique bacterial exometabolites remained detectable. Further experiments with the bacterial exometabolome DOM mixtures using enhanced instrument settings resulted in increased detection of the exometabolites at low concentrations. At 1000 and 10,000 accumulated scans, 23\% and 29\% of the unique molecular formulae were detectable at low concentrations, respectively. Moreover, windowing a specific mass range encompassing a representative fraction of exometabolites tripled the number of unique detected formulae at low concentrations. Routine FT-ICR-MS settings are thus not always sufficient to distinguish bacterial exometabolome patterns from a seawater DOM background. To observe these patterns at higher sensitivity, we recommend a high scan number coupled with windowing a characteristic region of the molecular fingerprint.},

	abstract = {The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of Svalbard‚Äôs glacier meltwater has received limited attention. Due to the northward ocean current, terrestrial DOC output from Svalbard eventually enters the Arctic Ocean, rather than travelling southward into the Atlantic. This makes the role of Svalbard glaciers in the Arctic marine carbon budget significantly different from that of Greenland glaciers. Field work was conducted in Ny-√Ölesund, Svalbard in late summer, 2017 to reveal the fate of DOC in turbid glacier meltwaters in Svalbard. Based on mixing incubation over 25¬†h, bio- and photo-degradation over 10 days, and long-term biodegradation over 13 months, it is believed that glacier meltwater DOC fraction is linearly mixed and diluted with seawater in the turbid plume area due to light limitation. When the light limitation is removed (e.g., in the clear offshore waters), 78\% of the DOC undergoes photo-degradation or photo-triggered synergistic degradation within 10 days, rather than solely microbial degradation. Over the long-term, 73\% of initial DOC was lost after being kept in the dark for 13 months. This work underlines that 4/5 of the Svalbard glaciers DOC would be degraded in Arctic coast within 10 days after entering the sea, generating a positive feedback to global warming. Photo-degradation, and/or photo-triggered synergistic degradation, is the key mechanism. Approximately one-fifth of the original concentration exhibited resistance and this fraction of DOC would be transported out of the fjord and likely into the Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {In this work, we explore the seasonal relationships (i.e., the phenology) between sea ice retreat, sea surface temperature (SST), and atmospheric heat fluxes in the Pacific Sector of the Arctic Ocean, using satellite and reanalysis data. We find that where ice retreats early in most years, maximum summertime SSTs are usually warmer, relative to areas with later retreat. For any particular year, we find that anomalously early ice retreat generally leads to anomalously warm SSTs. However, this relationship is weak in the Chukchi Sea, where ocean advection plays a large role. It is also weak where retreat in a particular year happens earlier than usual, but still relatively late in the season, primarily because atmospheric heat fluxes are weak at that time. This result helps to explain the very different ocean warming responses found in two recent years with extreme ice retreat, 2007 and 2012. We also find that the timing of ice retreat impacts the date of maximum SST, owing to a change in the ocean surface buoyancy and momentum forcing that occurs in early August that we term the Late Summer Transition (LST). After the LST, enhanced mixing of the upper ocean leads to cooling of the ocean surface even while atmospheric heat fluxes are still weakly downward. Our results indicate that in the near-term, earlier ice retreat is likely to cause enhanced ocean surface warming in much of the Arctic Ocean, although not where ice retreat still occurs late in the season.},

	abstract = {Natural organic matter (NOM) is a highly complex mixture of natural organic molecules. The recent developments in NOM molecular characterization methods have shown that ESI-FT-ICR hyphenated with liquid chromatography (LC) is a promising approach to also obtain chemical information (such as polarity and molecular size) about NOM molecules. However, due to changing solvent composition during gradient elution in LC-FT-ICR-MS, ionization conditions also change throughout the chromatographic separation process. In this study, we applied a post-LC column counter gradient (CG) to ensure stable solvent conditions for transient ESI-MS signals. Suwanee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) standard and a peat pore water were used as representative dissolved NOM samples for method development and validation. Our results show that in polar NOM fractions (which elute with {\textless}50\% methanol) the TIC intensity and number of assigned molecular formulas were increased by 48\% and 20\%, as compared to the standard gradient (SG) method. Further application of a Q-isolation and selective ion accumulation for low abundance fractions revealed over 3 times more molecular formulas (especially for CHNO, CHOS, CHNOS formula classes) than in full scan mode. The number of detected highly polar NOM compounds (with elemental ratios H/C {\textless} 1, O/C {\textgreater} 0.6) were more than 20 times larger for CG-LC mode as compared to direct infusion (DI) (5715 vs 266 MF). We conclude that the application of a postcolumn counter gradient in LC-FT-ICR-MS analyses of NOM offers novel insight into the most polar fractions of NOM which are inaccessible in conventional DI measurements.},

	abstract = {Ionization efficiency (IE) of different compounds in electrospray ionization (ESI) source differs widely, leading to widely differing sensitivities of ESI-MS to different analytes. An approach for quantifying ESI efficiencies (as logIE values) and setting up a self-consistent quantitative experimental ESI efficiency scale of organic compounds under predefined ionization conditions (ionization by monoprotonation) has been developed recently. Using this approach a logIE scale containing 62 compounds of different chemical nature and ranging for 6 orders of magnitude has been established. The scale is based on over 400 relative IE (ŒîlogIE) measurements between more than 250 different pairs of compounds. To evaluate which molecular parameters contribute the most to the IE of a compound linear regression analysis logIE values and different molecular parameters were carried out. The two most influential parameters in predicting the IE in ESI source are the pKa and the molecular volume of the compound. This scale and the whole approach can be a tool for practicing liquid chromatographists and mass spectrometrists. It can be used in any mass-spectrometry laboratory and we encourage practitioners to characterize their analytes with the logIE values so that a broad knowledge base on electrospray ionization efficiencies of compounds would eventually develop.},

The instrument includes a commercial dual linear quadrupole trap front end that features high sensitivity, precise control of trapped ion number, and collisional and electron transfer dissociation. A third linear quadrupole trap offers high ion capacity and ejection efficiency, and rf quadrupole ion injection optics deliver ions to a novel dynamically harmonized ICR cell. Mass resolving power of 150,000 (m/Œîm50\%) is achieved for bovine serum albumin (66¬†kDa) for a 0.38¬†s detection period, and greater than 2,000,000 resolving power is achieved for a 12¬†s detection period. Externally calibrated broadband mass measurement accuracy is typically less than 150¬†ppb rms, with resolving power greater than 300,000 at m/z 400 for a 0.76¬†s detection period. Combined analysis of electron transfer and collisional dissociation spectra results in 68\% sequence coverage for carbonic anhydrase.

	abstract = {This review offers an introduction to the principles and generic applications of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance/mass spectrometry (FTICR/MS), directed to readers with no prior experience with the technique. The fundamental Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) phenomenon is explained from a simplified theoretical treatment of ion behavior in idealized magnetic and electric fields. The effects of trapping voltage, trap size and shape, and other nonidealities are then manifested mainly as perturbations that preserve the idealized ion behavior modified by appropriate numerical correction factors. Topics include: effect of ion mass, charge, magnetic field, and trapping voltage on ion cyclotron frequency; excitation and detection of ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) signals; mass calibration; mass resolving power and mass accuracy; upper mass limit(s); dynamic range; detection limit, strategies for mass and energy selection for multiple mass spectroscopy (MSn); ion axialization, cooling, and remeasurement; and means for guiding externally formed ions into the ion trap. The relationship of FTICR/MS to other types of Fourier transform (FT) spectroscopy and to the Paul (quadrupole) ion trap is described. The article concludes with selected applications, an appendix listing accurate fundamental constants needed for ultrahigh-precision analysis, and an annotated list of selected reviews and primary source publications describing various FTICR/MS techniques and applications in fuller detail.},

	abstract = {Because of the increasing importance of heavy and unconventional crude oil as an energy source, there is a growing need for petroleomics: the pursuit of more complete and detailed knowledge of the chemical compositions of crude oil. Crude oil has an extremely complex nature; hence, techniques with ultra-high resolving capabilities, such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), are necessary. FT-ICR MS has been successfully applied to the study of heavy and unconventional crude oils such as bitumen and shale oil. However, the analysis of crude oil with FT-ICR MS is not trivial, and it has pushed analysis to the limits of instrumental and methodological capabilities. For example, high-resolution mass spectra of crude oils may contain over 100,000 peaks that require interpretation. To visualize large data sets more effectively, data processing methods such as Kendrick mass defect analysis and statistical analyses have been developed. The successful application of FT-ICR MS to the study of crude oil has been critically dependent on key developments in FT-ICR MS instrumentation and data processing methods. This review offers an introduction to the basic principles, FT-ICR MS instrumentation development, ionization techniques, and data interpretation methods for petroleomics and is intended for readers having no prior experience in this field of study. ¬© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The biodegradability of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (tDOM) exported to the sea has a major impact on the global carbon cycle, but our understanding of tDOM bioavailability is fragmentary. In this study, the effects of preparative tDOM isolation on microbial decomposition were investigated in incubation experiments consisting of mesocosms containing mesohaline water from the Baltic Sea. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) consumption, molecular DOM composition, bacterial activities, and shifts in bacterial community structure were compared between mesocosms supplemented with riverine tDOM, either as filtered, particle-free river water or as a concentrate obtained by lyophilization/tangential ultrafiltration, and those containing only Baltic Sea water or river water. As shown using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry (15 Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS) covering approximately 4600 different DOM compounds, the three DOM preparation protocols resulted in distinct patterns of molecular DOM composition. However, despite DOC losses of 4‚Äì16\% and considerable bacterial production, there was no significant change in DOM composition during the 28-day experiment. Moreover, tDOM addition affected neither DOC degradation nor bacterial dynamics significantly, regardless of the tDOM preparation. This result suggested that the introduced tDOM was largely not bioavailable, at least on the temporal scale of our experiment, and that the observed bacterial activity and DOC decomposition mainly reflected the degradation of unknown, labile, colloidal and low-molecular weight DOM, both of which escape the analytical window of FT-ICR-MS. In contrast to the different tDOM preparations, the initial bacterial inoculum and batch culture conditions determined bacterial community succession and superseded the effects of tDOM addition. The uncoupling of tDOM and bacterial dynamics suggests that mesohaline bacterial communities cannot efficiently utilize tDOM and that in subarctic estuaries other factors are responsible for the removal of imported tDOM.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was isolated from large volumes of deep (674 m) and surface (21 m) ocean water via reverse osmosis/electrodialysis (RO/ED) and two solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods (XAD-8/4 and PPL) at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA). By applying the three methods to common water samples, the efÔ¨Åciencies of XAD, PPL and RO/ED DOM isolation were compared. XAD recovered 42\% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from deep water (25\% with XAD-8; 17\% with XAD-4) and 30\% from surface water (16\% with XAD-8; 14\% with XAD-4). PPL recovered 61 ¬± 3\% of DOC from deep water and 61\% from surface water. RO/ED recovered 82 ¬± 3\% of DOC from deep water, 14 ¬± 3\% of which was recovered in a sodium hydroxide rinse, and 75 ¬± 5\% of DOC from surface water, with 12 ¬± 2\% in the sodium hydroxide rinse. The highest recoveries of all were achieved by the sequential isolation of DOC, Ô¨Årst with PPL and then via RO/ED. This combined technique recovered 98\% of DOC from a deep water sample and 101\% of DOC from a surface water sample. In total, 1.9, 10.3 and 1.6 g-C of DOC were collected via XAD, PPL and RO/ED, respectively. Rates of DOC recovery using the XAD, PPL and RO/ED methods were 10, 33 and 10 mg-C h‚àí1, respectively. Based upon C/N ratios, XAD isolates were heavily C-enriched compared with water column DOM, whereas RO/ ED and PPL ‚ûî RO/ED isolate C/N values were most representative of the original DOM. All techniques are suitable for the isolation of large amounts of DOM with purities suitable for most advanced analytical techniques. Coupling PPL and RO/ED techniques may provide substantial progress in the search for a method to quantitatively isolate oceanic DOC, bringing the entirety of the DOM pool within the marine chemist's analytical window.},

A total of 50 taxa of macro- and megafauna were collected including 2 species of siboglinid tubeworms and 3 species of bathymodiolin mussels. In general, the highest degree of similarity was between communities collected from the same site. Most of the dominant families at the well-characterized upper Louisiana slope seep sites of the Gulf of Mexico were present at the deep sites as well; however, there was little overlap at the species level between the upper and lower slope communities. One major difference in community structure between the upper and lower slope seeps was the dominance of the ophiuroid Ophioctenella acies in the deeper communities. The transition between upper and lower slope communities appears to occur between 1300 and 1700m based on the number of shared species with the Barbados seeps at either end of this depth range. Seep communities of the deep Gulf of Mexico were more similar to the Barbados Accretionary Prism seep communities than they were to either the upper slope Gulf of Mexico or Blake Ridge communities based on numbers of shared species and Bray‚ÄìCurtis similarity values among sites. The presence of shared species among these sites suggests that there is ongoing or recent exchange among these areas. An analysis of bathymodioline mussel phylogeography that includes new collections from the west coast of Africa is presented. This analysis also suggests recent exchange across the Atlantic equatorial belt from the Gulf of Mexico to the seeps of the West Nigerian margin.},

	abstract = {The feasibility of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for extracting dissolved organic matter (DOM) from seawater has been investigated. Solid phase extraction (SPE) operating in column and batch modes was used as an extractive technique, and the latter mode offered better performance. DOM adsorption was achieved using 60mg of MWCNTs per each 250mL of seawater subsample, working at pH 1.0 and under an orbital-horizontal shaking at 180rpm and 25¬∞C for 4h. DOM desorption from the MWCNTs support implied an orbital‚Äìhorizontal shaking (180rpm and 25¬∞C) for 2h using 10mL of a 0.1M sodium hydroxide solution (DOM determination), or using 20mL of alkaline methanol (pH 10.0) for DOM fractionation by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with UV detection at 205nm. A Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyzer with wet DOM oxidation (30\% (m/v) potassium peroxodisulphate in 6.0M phosphoric acid) under super critical conditions and with Non-Dispersive Infra Red (NDIR) for CO2 detection was used for DOM measurements. Calibration covered TOC concentrations within the 0.13‚Äì1000mgL‚àí1 range. The percentage of DOM retained in the MWCNTs support was dependent on the seawater sample, and it varied from 34 to 81\%. This means that only the DOM of certain molecular weights is capable to interact with the SPE support. Various SEC columns, ranging from 100 to 7000 and from 500 to 15,000Da (optimum separation range for peptides), were therefore used for DOM fractionation. Results have shown that DOM of low molecular weight is retained in the MWCNTs (fractions within the ranges of 125‚Äì1102Da and 6.88‚Äì125Da).},

	abstract = {Analysis of cellular membrane lipids has been widely applied to describe the microbial community composition in natural systems. When combined with stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments, deuterium label (D2O) uptake into lipids enables assessment of microbial biomass production. We performed SIP on methane-rich, hydrothermally-heated sediments to examine the de novo production of individual archaeal intact polar lipids (IPLs) by mesophilic anaerobic methane oxidizing group-1 archaea (ANME-1). The greatest extent of label uptake was by phosphatidyl glycerol archaeol (PG-AR), reaching 50\% of the medium‚Äôs label concentration in only 10days. This indicates PG-AR as an important cell membrane lipid during the active growth phase of mesophilic ANME-1. Much less label uptake was into intact polar glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), especially for those bound to diglycosidic head groups. The low production of these GDGTs contrasts with their predominance in ANME-1-dominated natural samples. We attribute the differential label uptake among individual IPLs to the ANME-1 tetraether biosynthetic pathway. This mechanism likely involves head-to-head condensation of two molecules of PG-AR and progressive substitution of PG by glycosidic head groups. The observation that ANME-1 invest in the synthesis of diethers during optimum growth suggests intact ARs and/or phosphate-bearing tetraethers as important biomarkers for actively growing populations in natural environments, while the diglycosidic GDGTs appear to signal stationary ANME-1 communities.},

	abstract = {Previous biomarker studies of microbes involved in anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) have targeted non-polar lipids. We have extended the biomarker approach to include intact polar lipids (IPLs) and show here that the major community types involved in AOM at marine methane seeps can be clearly distinguished by these compounds. The lipid profile of methanotrophic communities with dominant ANME-1 archaea mainly comprises diglycosidic GDGT derivatives. IPL distributions of microbial communities dominated by ANME-2 or ANME-3 are consistent with their phylogenetic affiliation with the euryarchaeal order Methanosarcinales, i.e., the lipids are dominated by phosphate-based polar derivatives of archaeol and hydroxyarchaeol. IPLs of associated bacteria strongly differed among the three community types analyzed here; these differences testify to the diversity of bacteria in AOM environments. Generally, the bacterial members of methanotrophic communities are dominated by phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidyl-(N,N)-dimethylethanolamine species; polar dialkylglycerolethers are dominant in the ANME-1 community while in ANME-2 and ANME-3 communities mixed acyl/ether glycerol derivatives are most abundant. The relative concentration of bacterial lipids associated with ANME-1 dominated communities appears significantly lower than in ANME-2 and ANME-3 dominated communities. Our results demonstrate that IPL analysis provides valuable molecular fingerprints of biomass composition in natural microbial communities and enables taxonomic differentiation at the rank of families to orders.},

	abstract = {Oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM) comprises a complex molecular mixture which is typically refractory and homogenous in the deep layers of the ocean. Though the refractory nature of deep-sea DOM is increasingly attributed to microbial metabolism, it remains unexplored whether ubiquitous microbial metabolism of distinct carbon substrates could lead to similar molecular composition of refractory DOM. Here, we conducted microbial incubation experiments using four typically bioavailable substrates (L-alanine, trehalose, sediment DOM extract, and diatom lysate) to investigate how exogenous substrates are transformed by a natural microbial assemblage. The results showed that although each-substrate-amendment induced different changes in the initial microbial assemblage and the amended substrates were almost depleted after 90 days of dark incubation, the bacterial community compositions became similar in all incubations on day 90. Correspondingly, revealed by ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry, molecular composition of DOM in all incubations became compositionally consistent with recalcitrant DOM and similar toward that of DOM from the deep-sea. These results indicate that while the composition of natural microbial communities can shift with substrate exposures, long-term microbial transformation of distinct substrates can ultimately lead to a similar refractory DOM composition. These findings provide an explanation for the homogeneous and refractory features of deep-sea DOM.},

Specific CI-h oxadation rates of up to 0.15 day- 1 corresponding to turnover times on the order of 1 week, are the highest such rates so far reported for the water column of any marine environment. Specific methane oxidation rates within the plume were found to be highest at distances of 2-5 k downplume from the vent field of origin. Ambient CH4 oxidation rates were highest in the lateral plume immediately above the vent field where CH4 concentraUons were maximal. Methane oxidation rates appeared to be sufficient to account for the majority of CI-h loss m the plume which could not be attributed to dilutaon. Oxidation of vent-derived CI-]4 within the lateral plume can contribute an amount of orgamc carbon equivalent to up to 150\% of that reaching the depth of the plume from surface primary production, suggesting that microhial CI-I4 oxidation can have a significant impact on local deep-sea productivity in the immediate vicinity of oceanic spreading centers.},

Comparison of the tracer concentrations and temperature anomalies in such plumes with direct measurements of the pure vent waters shows that the plumes are typically mixtures of 1 part vent water with 104 parts ambient sea water1. However, the extent to which hydrothermal plumes entrain and transport sea water and contribute to deep-ocean mixing is not known. We present here hydrographie data collected in the vicinity of an active hydrothermal field on the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge where a well-defined effluent layer resides in the water column ‚àº200 m above the depth of the vent field. The temperature and salinity signature of this layer indicates that a small volume of hot vent water can be very efficient at entraining ambient sea water. Directly above the Endeavour vent field, the effluent layer is composed of 0.01\% vent water, 30\% ambient water normally found at that depth, and ‚àº70\% entrained water which has been transported from deeper in the water column.},

Recent evidence indicates that many organic N compounds are released into the DON pool and taken up from this pool by planktonic microbiota on timescales of hours to days. This observation suggests that many components of the DON pool can play an active role in supplying N nutrition directly or indirectly to phytoplankton and bacteria and, in so doing, may affect the species composition of the ambient microbial assemblage. Here we present an overview of the state of knowledge of DON pools in aquatic environments, focused mainly on data gathered in the last decade. We review information on DON concentrations in freshwater and marine systems, analytical methods for the determination of DON, and the biotic and abiotic sources and sinks of DON. More detailed discussion addresses specific components of the DON pool: urea, dissolved combined and free amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, amino sugars, and humic substances. The DON pool in natural waters is not inert and can be an important sink and source for N. There is a need for greater appreciation and understanding of the potential role of DON as a dynamic participant in the nitrogen cycle within aquatic ecosystems, particularly in freshwater environments.},

First, DON concentrations and distributions in aquatic environments are reviewed with respect to the methods used to analyze DON concentrations, global distributions, comparison of DON concentration across a range of aquatic systems and seasonal variations. Second, the composition of the characterizable and uncharacterized DON is reviewed with respect to pools of specific DON forms and the methods used to study and chemical characteristics of the fraction of the DON pool that is not defined. Third, sources of DON to the water column are reviewed with respect to autochthonous sources, allochthonous sources, methods used to measure rates of DON release and release rates of bulk DON and individual DON forms in the literature. The final section reviews sinks for DON with respect to DON bioavailability, methods used to estimate DON uptake rates, mechanisms that contribute to DON bioavailability, and DON uptake rates published in the literature.

	abstract = {Hydrothermal vents are an important contributor to marine biogeochemistry, producing large volumes of reduced fluids, gasses, and metals and housing unique, productive microbial and animal communities fueled by chemosynthesis. Methane is a common constituent of hydrothermal vent fluid and is frequently consumed at vent sites by methanotrophic bacteria that serve to control escape of this greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Despite their ecological and geochemical importance, little is known about the ecophysiology of uncultured hydrothermal vent-associated methanotrophic bacteria. Using metagenomic binning techniques, we recovered and analyzed a near-complete genome from a novel gammaproteobacterial methanotroph (B42) associated with a white smoker chimney in the Southern Lau basin. B42 was the dominant methanotroph in the community, at ‚àº80x coverage, with only four others detected in the metagenome, all on low coverage contigs (7x‚Äì12x). Phylogenetic placement of B42 showed it is a member of the Methylothermaceae, a family currently represented by only one sequenced genome. Metabolic inferences based on the presence of known pathways in the genome showed that B42 possesses a branched respiratory chain with A- and B-family heme copper oxidases, cytochrome bd oxidase and a partial denitrification pathway. These genes could allow B42 to respire over a wide range of oxygen concentrations within the highly dynamic vent environment. Phylogenies of the denitrification genes revealed they are the result of separate horizontal gene transfer from other Proteobacteria and suggest that denitrification is a selective advantage in conditions where extremely low oxygen concentrations require all oxygen to be used for methane activation.},

	abstract = {Molecular diversity of deep-sea hydrothermal vent aerobic methanotrophs was studied using both 16S ribosomalDNA and pmoA encoding the subunit A of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMOA). Hydrothermal vent plume and chimney samples were collected from back-arc vent at Mid-Okinawa Trough (MOT), Japan, and the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) site along Mid-Atlantic Ridge, respectively. The target genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the bulk DNA using specific primers and cloned. Fifty clones from each clone library were directly sequenced. The 16S rDNA sequences were grouped into 3 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 2 from MOT and 1 from TAG. Two OTUs (1 MOT and 1 TAG) were located within the branch of type I methanotrophic ?-Proteobacteria. Another MOT OTU formed a unique phylogenetic lineage related to type I methanotrophs. Direct sequencing of 50 clones each from the MOT and TAG samples yielded 17 and 4 operational pmoA units (OPUs), respectively. The phylogenetic tree based on the pMOA amino acid sequences deduced from OPUs formed diverse phylogenetic lineages within the branch of type I methanotrophs, except for the OPU MOT-pmoA-8 related to type X methanotrophs. The deduced pMOA topologies were similar to those of all known pMOA, which may suggest that the pmoA gene is conserved through evolution. Neither the 16S rDNA nor pmoA molecular analysis could detect type II methanotrophs, which suggests the absence of type II methanotrophs in the collected vent samples.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a large and complex mixture of molecules that fuels microbial metabolism and regulates biogeochemical cycles. Individual DOM molecules have unique functional traits, but how their assemblages vary deterministically under global change remains poorly understood. Here, we examine DOM and associated bacteria in 300 aquatic microcosms deployed on mountainsides that span contrasting temperatures and nutrient gradients. Based on molecular trait dimensions of reactivity and activity, we partition the DOM composition into labile-active, recalcitrant-active, recalcitrant-inactive, and labile-inactive fractions and quantify the relative influences of deterministic and stochastic processes governing the assembly of each. At both subtropical and subarctic study sites, the assembly of labile or recalcitrant molecules in active fractions is primarily governed by deterministic processes, while stochastic processes are more important for the assembly of molecules within inactive fractions. Surprisingly, the importance of deterministic selection increases with global change gradients for recalcitrant molecules in both active and inactive fractions, and this trend is paralleled by changes in the deterministic assembly of microbial communities and environmental filtering, respectively. Together, our results highlight the shift in focus from potential reactivity to realized activity and indicate that active and inactive fractions of DOM assemblages are structured by contrasting processes, and their recalcitrant components are consistently sensitive to global change. Our study partitions the DOM molecular composition across functional traits and links DOM with microbes via a shared ecological framework of assembly processes. This integrated approach opens new avenues to understand the assembly and turnover of organic carbon in a changing world.},

	abstract = {The diagenetic cycling of carbon within recent unconsolidated sediments and soils generally can be followed more effectively by discerning changes in the dissolved constituents of the interstitial fluids, rather than by monitoring changes in the bulk or solid organic components. The major dissolved carbon species in diagenetic settings are represented by the two carbon redox end-members CH4 and CO2. Bacterial uptake by methanogens of either CO2 or ‚Äúpreformed‚Äù reduced carbon substrates such as acetate, methanol or methylated amines can be tracked with the aid of carbon (13C/12C) and hydrogen (D/H‚â°2H/1H) isotopes. The bacterial reduction of CO2 to CH4 is associated with a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for carbon which discriminates against 13C. This leads to carbon isotope separation between CO2 and CH4 (ŒµC) exceeding 95 and gives rise to Œ¥13CCH4 values as negative as ‚àí110‚Ä∞ vs. PDB. The carbon KIE associated with fermentation of methylated substrates is lower (ŒµC is ca. 40 to 60, with Œ¥13CCH4 values of ‚àí50‚Ä∞ to ‚àí60‚Ä∞). Hydrogen isotope effects during methanogenesis of methylated substrates can lead to deuterium depletions as large as Œ¥DCH4=‚àí531‚Ä∞ vs. SMOW, whereas, bacterial D/H discrimination for the CO2-reduction pathway is significantly less (Œ¥DCH4 ca. ‚àí170‚Ä∞ to ‚àí250‚Ä∞). These field observations have been confirmed by culture experiments with labeled isotopes, although hydrogen isotope exchange and other factors may influence the hydrogen distributions. Bacterial consumption of CH4, both aerobic and anaerobic, is also associated with KIEs for C and H isotopes that enrich the residual CH4 in the heavier isotopes. Carbon fractionation factors related to CH4 oxidation are generally less than ŒµC=10, although values {\textgreater}20 are known. The KIE for hydrogen (ŒµH) during aerobic and anaerobic CH4 oxidation is between 95 and 285. The differences in C and H isotope ratios of CH4, in combination with the isotope ratios of the coexisting H2O and CO2 pairs, differentiate the various bacterial CH4 generation and consumption pathways, and elucidate the cycling of labile sedimentary carbon.},

	abstract = {Alkanes are saturated apolar hydrocarbons that range from its simplest form, methane, to high-molecular-weight compounds. Although alkanes were once considered biologically recalcitrant under anaerobic conditions, microbiological investigations have now identified several microbial taxa that can anaerobically degrade alkanes. Here we review recent discoveries in the anaerobic oxidation of alkanes with a specific focus on archaea that use specific methyl coenzyme M reductases to activate their substrates. Our understanding of the diversity of uncultured alkane-oxidizing archaea has expanded through the use of environmental metagenomics and enrichment cultures of syntrophic methane-, ethane-, propane-, and butane-oxidizing marine archaea with sulfate-reducing bacteria. A recently cultured group of archaea directly couples long-chain alkane degradation with methane formation, expanding the range of substrates used for methanogenesis. This article summarizes the rapidly growing knowledge of the diversity, physiology, and habitat distribution of alkane-degrading archaea.

	abstract = {The pronounced warming at high latitude alters a range of physical conditions i.e. the magnitude of runoff, sea-ice extent and strength of stratification and thus affect the biological systems. As microorganisms form the living base of the pelagic food web and are the major drives of biogeochemical processing it is critical to understand their response to these changes. This Ph.D. project focuses on the smallest (\&lt;2Œºm) and most abundant microorganisms, heterotrophic bacterioplankton (bacteria and Archaea) and autotrophic picophytoplankton, and the factors regulating their abundance, diversity and activity in the Arctic-Subarctic Atlantic Ocean. The study covers hydrographic regimes off and around Iceland, Norway (including Svalbard) and East Greenland (60-83¬∞N), and combines field observations and experiments during different seasons. The main aim is to elucidate the three following topics: 1) Challenges phytoplankton face related to high seasonality and low light conditions 2) Bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to bacterial communities and their response to an increase in terrestrial loading 3) Importance of top-down control by heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) on both pico-sized phytoplankton and bacteria. My study underpins that picophytoplankton are important contributors to primary production, especially during the winter-spring transition (Paper I and III) and autumn (Paper V). They boosted the growth of heterotrophic microorganisms before the onset of the diatom spring bloom in the Subarctic Atlantic (Paper I) and dominated the phytoplankton biomass in the high turbid parts of a NE Greenland fjord influenced by glacial meltwater (Paper V). Picophytoplankton were better adapted to low light conditions and demonstrated higher growth rates, than larger phytoplankton (Paper I, II, III, V). In the Polar-influenced water near Greenland, Synechococcus were negligible, while in the Atlantic influenced waters picoeukaryotes and Synechococcus were often equally abundant and the latter dominated on several occasions during autumn and winter (Paper I and III). Unexpectedly, abundances of Synechococcus were as high at 65¬∞N as at 79¬∞N, and molecular analysis suggests the presence of new clades specially adapted to Arctic conditions. Bacteria were generally rather carbon- than nutrient limited, and their abundance increased rapidly in response to the pre-bloom picophytoplankton production of labile carbon in both the Arctic and Subarctic (Paper I and V). In NE Greenland the terrestrial DOM supplied from the Greenland ice sheet proved to be highly bioavailable compared to the autochthonous fjord DOM (Paper IV). The in situ changes in DOM, which were examined via fluorescence signal of different DOM components (FDOM), surprisingly demonstrated that the highest net-growth of bacteria was not coupled to the labile glacial runoff in the surface, but rather to sub-surface the humic-DOM, commonly considered to be refractory. This may be explained by the presence of specific dominating taxa of bacteria that had the ability to degrade humic-DOM (Paper V). Across regions, HNF exerted strong control of picophytoplankton and bacteria (Paper I, II, III, V). HNF grew significantly faster than microzooplankton and were therefore less affected by mixing and relatively more important grazers than their micro-sized counterparts in well-mixed water columns (Paper I and II). HNF larger than 5Œºm controlled picophytoplankton particularly in the early productive season, while small HNF (3-5Œºm) mainly kept bacteria in check in autumn (Paper III, V). In conclusion, the studies underline that pico-sized plankton play a fundamental part in the carbon transfer in high latitude ecosystems both as primary producers and via the microbial loop. Picophytoplankton appeared better adapted than larger phytoplankton to low light conditions, and bacteria were capable of degrading terrestrial derived DOM, however, these abilities are highly community specific. The data suggest that a change in mixing patters will affect the microbial food structure and that shifts in coastal microbial community composition should be anticipated with increased runoff.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the largest organic carbon reservoir in the ocean and an integral component of biogeochemical cycles. The role of free-living microbes in DOM transformation has been studied thoroughly, whereas little attention has been directed towards the influence of benthic organisms. Sponges are efficient filter feeders and common inhabitants of many benthic communities circumglobally. Here, we investigated how two tropical coral reef sponges shape marine DOM. We compared bacterial abundance, inorganic and organic nutrients in off reef, sponge inhalant, and sponge exhalant water of Melophlus sarasinorum and Rhabdastrella globostellata. DOM and bacterial cells were taken up, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen was released by the two Indo-Pacific sponges. Both sponge species utilized a common set of 142 of a total of 3040 compounds detected in DOM on a molecular formula level via ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. In addition, species-specific uptake was observed, likely due to differences in their associated microbial communities. Overall, the sponges removed presumably semi-labile and semi-refractory compounds from the water column, thereby competing with pelagic bacteria. Within minutes, sponge holobionts altered the molecular composition of surface water DOM (inhalant) into a composition similar to deep-sea DOM (exhalent). The apparent radiocarbon age of DOM increased consistently from off reef and inhalant to exhalant by about 900 14C years for M. sarasinorum. In the pelagic, similar transformations require decades to centuries. Our results stress the dependence of DOM lability definition on the respective environment and illustrate that sponges are hotspots of DOM transformation in the ocean.},

	abstract = {We describe considerations and strategies for developing a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) sample preparation method to extract low molecular weight metabolites from high-salt spent media in a model coculture system of phytoplankton and marine bacteria. Phytoplankton perform half the carbon fixation and oxygen generation on Earth. A substantial fraction of fixed carbon becomes part of a metabolite pool of small molecules known as dissolved organic matter (DOM), which are taken up by marine bacteria proximate to phytoplankton. There is an urgent need to elucidate these metabolic exchanges due to widespread anthropogenic transformations on the chemical, phenotypic, and species composition of seawater. These changes are increasing water temperature and the amount of CO2 absorbed by the ocean at energetic costs to marine microorganisms. Little is known about the metabolite-mediated, structured interactions occurring between phytoplankton and associated marine bacteria, in part because of challenges in studying high-salt solutions on various analytical platforms. NMR analysis is problematic due to the high-salt content of both natural seawater and culture media for marine microbes. High-salt concentration degrades the performance of the radio frequency coil, reduces the efficiency of some pulse sequences, limits signal-to-noise, and prolongs experimental time. The method described herein can reproducibly extract low molecular weight DOM from small-volume, high-salt cultures. It is a promising tool for elucidating metabolic flux between marine microorganisms and facilitates genetic screens of mutant microorganisms.},

The details of this important step in the global carbon cycle remain poorly resolved, largely due to the methodological challenges of studying a diverse pool of metabolites that are produced and consumed nearly simultaneously. In this perspective, a new compilation of published data builds on previous studies to obtain an updated estimate of the fraction of marine net primary production that passes through the labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. In agreement with previous studies, our data mining and modeling approaches hypothesize that about half of ocean net primary production is processed through the labile DOC pool. The fractional contributions from three major sources are estimated at 0.4 for living phytoplankton, 0.4 for dead and dying phytoplankton, and 0.2 for heterotrophic microbes and mesoplankton.},

The oceans are a natural source of methane contributing to atmospheric methane concentrations, yet our understanding of the oceanic methane cycle is poorly constrained. Accumulating evidence indicates that a significant part of oceanic CH{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} is produced in oxygenated surface waters as a by-product of phytoplanktonic activity. This study focused on the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean (26{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚àò}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} N, 80{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚Ä≤}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} W and 26{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚àò}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} N, 18{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚Ä≤}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} W) where the distribution of dissolved CH{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} concentrations and associated air‚Äìsea fluxes during winter 2020 were investigated. Water samples from 64 stations were collected from the upper water column up to depths of 400 m. The upper oxic mixed layer was oversaturated in dissolved CH{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} with concentrations ranging 3‚Äì7 nmol L{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚àí1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, with the highest concentrations of 7‚Äì10 nmol L{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚àí1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} found to the east of the transect, consistent with other subtropical regions of the world's oceans. The high anomalies of dissolved CH{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} were found to be associated with phosphate-depleted waters and regions where the abundance of the ubiquitous picocyanobacteria \textit{Synechococcus} and \textit{Prochlorococcus} were elevated. Although other phytoplanktonic phyla cannot be excluded, this suggests that cyanobacteria contribute to the release of CH{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} in this region. The calculation of air‚Äìsea fluxes further confirmed the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean as a source of CH{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. This study provides evidence to corroborate the key role that picocyanobacteria play in helping to explain the oversaturation of CH{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} found in surface mixed layer of the open ocean, otherwise known as the ‚Äúocean methane paradox‚Äù.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we use a biogeochemical model to estimate the autotrophic and heterotrophic production rates of microbial communities in hydrothermal plumes and validate it with in situ data. We show how substrate limitation might prevent net chemolithoautotrophic production in hydrothermal plumes. Elevated prokaryotic heterotrophic production rates (up to 0.9 gCm‚àí2y‚àí1) compared to the surrounding seawater could lead to 0.05‚ÄâGtCy‚àí1 of C-biomass produced through chemoorganotrophy within hydrothermal plumes, similar to the Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) export fluxes reported in the deep ocean.

Despite this important microbial influence on marine geochemistry, the ecology and activity of microbial communities in hydrothermal plumes is largely unexplored. Here, we use a coordinated metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach to compare microbial communities in Guaymas Basin hydrothermal plumes to background waters above the plume and in the adjacent Carmen Basin. Despite marked increases in plume total RNA concentrations (3‚Äì4 times) and microbially mediated manganese oxidation rates (15‚Äì125 times), plume and background metatranscriptomes were dominated by the same groups of methanotrophs and chemolithoautotrophs. Abundant community members of Guaymas Basin seafloor environments (hydrothermal sediments and chimneys) were not prevalent in the plume metatranscriptome. De novo metagenomic assembly was used to reconstruct genomes of abundant populations, including Marine Group I archaea, Methylococcaceae, SAR324 Deltaproteobacteria and SUP05 Gammaproteobacteria. Mapping transcripts to these genomes revealed abundant expression of genes involved in the chemolithotrophic oxidation of ammonia (amo), methane (pmo) and sulfur (sox). Whereas amo and pmo gene transcripts were abundant in both plume and background, transcripts of sox genes for sulfur oxidation from SUP05 groups displayed a 10‚Äì20-fold increase in plumes. We conclude that the biogeochemistry of Guaymas Basin hydrothermal plumes is mediated by microorganisms that are derived from seawater rather than from seafloor hydrothermal environments such as chimneys or sediments, and that hydrothermal inputs serve as important electron donors for primary production in the deep Gulf of California.},

The oxidation of reduced compounds dissolved in the venting fluids fuels primary production providing the basis for extensive life. Until recently studies of microbial vent communities have focused primarily on chemolithoautotrophic organisms. In our study, we targeted the change of microbial community compositions along mixing gradients, focusing on distribution and capabilities of heterotrophic microorganisms. Samples were retrieved from different venting areas within the Menez Gwen hydrothermal field, taken along mixing gradients, including diffuse fluid discharge points, their immediate surroundings and the buoyant parts of hydrothermal plumes. High throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and targeted metagenome analysis were combined with geochemical analyses. Close to diffuse venting orifices dominated by chemolithoautotrophic Epsilonproteobacteria, in areas where environmental conditions still supported chemolithoautotrophic processes, we detected microbial communities enriched for versatile heterotrophic Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. The potential for alkane degradation could be shown for several genera and yet uncultured clades. We propose that hotspots of chemolithoautotrophic life support a ‚Äòbelt‚Äô of heterotrophic bacteria significantly different from the dominating oligotrophic microbiota of the deep sea.},

	abstract = {Ammonium was injected from the subseafloor hydrothermal system at the Endeavour Segment, Juan de Fuca Ridge, into the deep-sea water column resulting in an NH4+-rich (‚©Ω177nM) neutrally buoyant hydrothermal plume. This NH4+ was quickly removed by both autotrophic ammonia oxidation and assimilation. The former accounted for at least 93\% of total net NH4+ removal, with its maximum rate in the neutrally buoyant plume (‚©Ω53nMd‚àí1) up to 10-fold that in background deep water. Ammonia oxidation in this plume potentially added 26‚Äì130mg NO3-m-2d-1 into the deep-sea water column. This oxidation process was heavily influenced by the presence of organic-rich particles, with which ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were often associated (40‚Äì68\%). AOB contributed up to 10.8\% of the total microbial communities within the plume, and might constitute a novel lineage of Œ≤-proteobacterial AOB based on 16S rRNA and amoA phylogenetic analyses. Meanwhile, NH4+ assimilation rates were also substantially enhanced within the neutrally buoyant plume (‚©Ω26.4nMd‚àí1) and accounted for at least 47\% of total net NH4+ removal rates. The combined NH4+ oxidation and assimilation rates always exceeded total net removal rates, suggesting active in situ NH4+regeneration rates of at least an order of magnitude greater than the particulate nitrogen flux from the euphotic zone. Ammonia oxidation is responsible for NH4+ turnover of 0.7‚Äì13days and is probably the predominant in situ organic carbon production process (0.6‚Äì13mgCm‚àí2d‚àí1) at early stages of Endeavour neutrally buoyant plumes.},

The lack of hydrogen sulfide within the Loihi hydrothermal fluids and the presence of an oxygen minimum zone at this submarine volcano‚Äôs summit, results in a prolonged presence of reduced Fe within the dispersing non-buoyant plume. In this study, we have investigated the potential for microbial carbon fixation within the Loihi plume. We sampled for both particulate and dissolved organic carbon in hydrothermal fluids, microbial mats growing around vents, and the dispersing plume, and carried out stable carbon isotope analysis on the particulate fraction. The Œ¥13C values of the microbial mats ranged from ‚àí23‚Ä∞ to ‚àí28‚Ä∞, and are distinct from those of deep-ocean particulate organic carbon (POC). The mats and hydrothermal fluids were also elevated in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compared to background seawater. Within the hydrothermal plume, DOC and POC concentrations were elevated and the isotopic composition of POC within the plume suggests mixing between background seawater POC and a 13C-depleted hydrothermal component. The combination of both DOC and POC increasing in the dispersing plume that cannot solely be the result of entrainment and DOC adsorption, provides strong evidence for in-situ microbial productivity by chemolithoautotrophs, including a likelihood for iron-oxidizing microorganisms.},

	abstract = {Background Methane is the major component of natural and shale gas. Methane can be converted into methanol via a bioprocess using methanotrophs, and methanol is a valuable chemical feedstock for the production of value-added chemicals. This work demonstrates highly effective bioconversion of methane to methanol using a newly isolated novel methanotroph, Methylomonas sp. DH-1. Results A novel methanotroph strain was isolated from activated sludge from a brewery plant and characterized using phylogenetic analysis, electron microscopy and chemotaxonomic analysis. This aerobic, Gram-negative, non-motile rod-shaped type I methanotroph was designated as Methylomonas sp. DH-1. The growth condition of Methylomonas sp. DH-1 and batch methane-to-methanol bioconversion conditions such as methane concentration, pH, biocatalyst loading, concentration of formate and MDH inhibitor were analyzed and optimized. Methanol was produced from methane with a 1.340 g L‚àí1 titer, a 0.332 g L‚àí1 h‚àí1 volumetric conversion rate and a 0.0752 g g‚àí1 cell h‚àí1 specific methanol conversion rate. Conclusion It was demonstrated that isolation and application of a new methanotroph strain is a practical way of improving bioconversion efficiency in the conversion of methane to methanol. Moreover, one promising feature of Methylomonas sp. DH-1 for methanol production was its extremely high tolerance to methanol up to 7\%(v/v), which is advantageous for high-titer methanol production. ¬© 2016 Society of Chemical Industry},

Data sets measured using these methods provide partly complementary information, and their joint analysis has the potential to reveal underlying structures, which are, otherwise, difficult to extract. While we can collect vast amounts of data using different analytical methods, data fusion remains a challenging task, in particular, when the goal is to capture the underlying factors and use them for interpretation, e.g., for biomarker identification. Furthermore, many data fusion applications require joint analysis of heterogeneous (i.e., in the form of higher order tensors and matrices) data sets with shared/unshared factors. In order to jointly analyze such heterogeneous data sets, we formulate data fusion as a coupled matrix and tensor factorization (CMTF) problem, which has already proved useful in many data mining applications, and discuss its extension to a structure-revealing data fusion model, i.e., a data fusion model that can identify shared and unshared factors. The traditional methods commonly used for data fusion in the presence of shared/unshared factors are matrix factorization-based methods. Using both simulations and prototypical experimental coupled data sets, we assess the performance of various state-of-the-art data fusion methods and demonstrate that while matrix factorization-based approaches have limitations when used for joint analysis of heterogeneous data sets, the structure-revealing CMTF model can successfully capture the underlying factors by exploiting the low-rank structure of higher order data sets.},

However, our understanding of DOM reactivity in natural systems is hampered by its complex molecular composition. Here, we used Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and data from two independent studies to disentangle DOM reactivity based on photochemical and microbial-induced transformations. Robust correlations of FT-ICR-MS peak intensities with chlorophyll a and solar irradiation were used to define 9 reactivity classes for 1277 common molecular formulas. Germany‚Äôs largest drinking water reservoir was sampled for 1 year, and DOM processing in stratified surface waters could be attributed to photochemical transformations during summer months. Microbial DOM alterations could be distinguished based on correlation coefficients with chlorophyll a and often shared molecular features (elemental ratios and mass) with photoreactive compounds. In particular, many photoproducts and some microbial products were identified as potential precursors of disinfection byproducts. Molecular DOM features were used to further predict molecular reactivity for the remaining compounds in the data set based on a random forest model. Our method offers an expandable classification approach to integrate the reactivity of DOM from specific environments and link it to molecular properties and chemistry.},

Due to their small size, they fall into the oceanographic size-class definition of dissolved organic matter (DOM; {\textless}0.7 Œºm). The purpose of our study was to investigate if there is a detectable imprint of virus particles in natural DOM following standard sample preparation and molecular analysis routines using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Therefore, we tested if a molecular signature deriving from virus particles can be detected in the DOM fingerprint of a bacterial culture upon prophage induction and of seawater containing the natural microbial community. Interestingly, the virus-mediated lysate of the infected bacterial culture differed from the cell material of a physically disrupted control culture in its molecular composition. Overall, a small subset of DOM compounds correlated significantly with virus abundances in the bacterial culture setup, accounting for {\textless}1\% of the detected molecular formulae and {\textless}2\% of the total signal intensity of the DOM dataset. These were phosphorus- and nitrogen-containing compounds and they were partially also detected in DOM samples from other studies that included high virus abundances. While some of these formulae matched with typical biomolecules that are constituents of viruses, others matched with bacterial cell wall components. Thus, the identified DOM molecular formulae were probably not solely derived from virus particles but were partially also derived from processes such as the virus-mediated bacterial cell lysis. Our results indicate that a virus-derived DOM signature is part of the natural DOM and barely detectable within the analytical window of ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry when a high natural background is present.},

As such, it comprises a formidable source of natural products promising significant potential for new biotechnological purposes. Great emphasis has been placed on understanding the role of DOM in biogeochemical cycles and climate attenuation, its lifespan, interaction with microorganisms, as well as its molecular composition. Yet, probing DOM bioactivities is in its infancy, largely because it is technically challenging due to the chemical complexity of the material. It is of considerable interest to develop technologies capable to better discern DOM bioactivities. Modern screening technologies are opening new avenues allowing accelerated identification of bioactivities for small molecules from natural products. These methods diminish a priori the need for laborious chemical fractionation. We examine here the application of untargeted metabolomics and multiplexed high-throughput molecular-phenotypic screening techniques that are providing first insights on previously undetectable DOM bioactivities.},

The method was then applied to several sample sets to demonstrate how to measure the Œ¶f of unknown DOM samples and to observe changes to Œ¶f following a processing mechanism (ozonation).

However, the study of dissolved polar metabolites in seawater and other environmental matrices has been hampered by analytical challenges including high inorganic ion concentrations, low analyte concentrations, and high chemical diversity. Here we show that a cation-exchange solid-phase extraction (CX-SPE) sample preparation approach separates positively charged and zwitterionic metabolites from seawater and freshwater samples, allowing their analysis by liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry. We successfully extracted 69 known compounds from an in-house compound collection and evaluated the performance of the method by establishing extraction efficiencies (EEs) and limits of detection (pM to low nM range) for these compounds. CX-SPE extracted a range of compounds including amino acids and compatible solutes, resulted in very low matrix effects, and performed robustly across large variations in salinity and dissolved organic matter concentration. We compared CX-SPE to an established SPE procedure (PPL-SPE) and demonstrate that these two methods extract fundamentally different fractions of the dissolved metabolite pool with CX-SPE extracting compounds that are on average smaller and more polar. We use CX-SPE to analyze four environmental samples from distinct aquatic biomes, producing some of the first CX-SPE dissolved metabolomes. Quantified compounds ranged in concentration from 0.0093 to 49 nM and were composed primarily of amino acids (0.15‚Äì16 nM) and compatible solutes such as trimethylamine N-oxide (0.89‚Äì49 nM) and glycine betaine (2.8‚Äì5.2 nM).},

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing number of researchers began to realize that an ERP only represents a certain part of the event-related electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. This chapter focuses on another aspect of event-related EEG activity: oscillatory EEG activity. There exists a meaningful relationship between oscillatory neuronal dynamics, on the one hand, and a wide range of cognitive processes, on the other hand. Given that the analysis of oscillatory dynamics extracts information from the EEG/magnetoencephalographic (EEG/MEG) signal that is largely lost with the traditional time-locked averaging of single trials used in the ERP approach, studying the dynamic oscillatory patterns in the EEG/MEG is at least a useful addition to the traditional ERP approach.},

We also tested how determiner-number specification modulates number agreement computation in both native and non-native processing by manipulating number marking with demonstrative determiners (the versus that/these). Results suggest both groups were sensitive to non-local agreement violations, indexed by longer reading times for sentences containing number violations. Furthermore, we found determiner-number specification facilitated processing of number violations in both native and non-native groups in an acceptability judgement task only, with stronger sensitivity to violations with demonstrative determiners than those with bare determiners. Contrary to some theories that predict qualitative differences between native and non-native processing, we did not find any significant differences between native and non-native speakers, despite the fact that the Chinese speakers of English had to process a novel linguistic feature absent in their native language.},

	abstract = {This book reviews recent research on the second language acquisition of meaning with a view of establishing whether there is a critical period for the acquisition of compositional semantics. A modular approach to language architecture is assumed. The book addresses the Critical Period Hypothesis by examining the positive side of language development: it demonstrates which modules of the grammar are easy to acquire and are not subject to age effects. The Bottleneck Hypothesis is proposed, which argues that inflectional morphology and its features present the most formidable challenge, while syntax and phrasal semantics pose less difficulty to learners. Findings from the neurofunctional imaging (PET, fMRI) and electrophysiology (ERPs) of L2 comprehension are reviewed and critically examined. Since it is argued that experimental tasks in those studies are mostly in need of linguistic refinement, evidence from behavioral studies of L2 acquisition of semantics are brought to bear on comprehension modeling. Learning situations are divided into two types: those presenting learners with complex syntax, but simple semantics; and those offering complex semantic mismatches in simple syntactic contexts. The numerous studies of both types reviewed in the book indicate that there is no barrier to ultimate success in the acquisition of phrasal semantics.},

Both participant groups showed evidence of linking fronted indirect objects to the subcategorizing verb when this was encountered, reflected in an N400 component. Evidence for continued filler activation beyond the verb was seen only in the non-native group, in the shape of a prolonged left-anterior negativity. Both participant groups showed sensitivity to filled indirect object gaps reflected in a P600 response, which was more pronounced and more globally distributed in our non-native group. Taken together, our results indicate that resolving indirect object dependencies is a two-step process in both native and non-native sentence comprehension, with greater processing cost incurred in non-native compared to native comprehension.},

How do speakers use the information carried by the controller to implement the correct form of the dependent element? We contrasted two accounts of this process that differ in their assumptions about the organization of language formulation. The serial account, patterned after an augmented-transition-network model of the parsing of discontinuous dependencies, suggests that the controller is held in working memory until the point in the string at which the dependent appears. A second hypothesis, derived from a hierarchical model of language production, predicts that controllers and dependents within the same clause are specified concurrently, even when they are eventually separated in the utterance. Using a procedure to elicit verb-agreement errors in speech, we found that agreement errors were more frequent after phrases than after clauses that separated the verb from its head noun, reversing the direction of a related effect in language comprehension. When length varied, longer phrases led to more errors; longer clauses did not. These results support the hierarchical hypothesis.},

We examined whether the incidence of such errors was related to the presence of subject-like semantic features in the immediate preverbal nouns, in light of current questions about the semantic versus syntactic nature of sentence subjects and the interactivity of language processing. In three experiments, speakers completed sentence fragments designed to elicit erroneous agreement. We varied the number and animacy of the head noun and the immediate preverbal (local) noun, as well as the amount of material separating the head noun from the verb. The plurality of the local noun phrase had a large and reliable effect on the incidence of agreement errors, but neither its animacy nor its length affected their occurrence. The latter findings suggest, respectively, that the semantic features of sentence subjects are of minimal relevance to the syntactic and morphological processes that implement agreement, and that agreement features are specified at a point in processing where the eventual length of sentential constituents has little effect on syntactic planning. Both results follow naturally from explanations of language production that emphasize the segregation of sentence formulation processes into relatively autonomous components.},

Several cognitive control processes have been associated with oscillations in the theta band, such as working memory and long-term memory retrieval, valenced feedback and feedback-driven learning, and decision making. Theta oscillations in the prefrontal cortex are observed even during quiet resting. The chapter also reviews key points about the functional/anatomical organisation of the medial prefrontal cortex that will facilitate thinking about how neural circuits in the cortex might produce theta oscillations and the computations underlying response conflict processes.

	abstract = {Studies of mechanisms in the brain that allow complicated things to happen in a coordinated fashion have produced some of the most spectacular discoveries in neuroscience. This book provides eloquent support for the idea that spontaneous neuron activity, far from being mere noise, is actually the source of our cognitive abilities. It takes a fresh look at the coevolution of structure and function in the mammalian brain, illustrating how self-emerged oscillatory timing is the brain's fundamental organizer of neuronal information. The small-world-like connectivity of the cerebral cortex allows for global computation on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The perpetual interactions among the multiple network oscillators keep cortical systems in a highly sensitive "metastable" state and provide energy-efficient synchronizing mechanisms via weak links. In a sequence of "cycles," Gy√∂rgy Buzs√°ki guides the reader from the physics of oscillations through neuronal assembly organization to complex cognitive processing and memory storage. His clear, fluid writing--accessible to any reader with some scientific knowledge--is supplemented by extensive footnotes and references that make it just as gratifying and instructive a read for the specialist. The coherent view of a single author who has been at the forefront of research in this exciting field, this volume is essential reading for anyone interested in our rapidly evolving understanding of the brain.

	abstract = {An important, but often ignored distinction in the analysis of EEG signals is that between evoked activity and induced activity. Whereas evoked activity reflects the summation of transient post-synaptic potentials triggered by an event, induced activity, which is mainly oscillatory in nature, is thought to reflect changes in parameters controlling dynamic interactions within and between brain structures. We hypothesize that induced activity may yield information about the dynamics of cell assembly formation, activation and subsequent uncoupling, which may play a prominent role in different types of memory operations. We then describe a number of analysis tools that can be used to study the reactivity of induced rhythmic activity, both in terms of amplitude changes and of phase variability. We briefly discuss how alpha, gamma and theta rhythms are thought to be generated, paying special attention to the hypothesis that the theta rhythm reflects dynamic interactions between the hippocampal system and the neocortex. This hypothesis would imply that studying the reactivity of scalp-recorded theta may provide a window on the contribution of the hippocampus to memory functions. We review studies investigating the reactivity of scalp-recorded theta in paradigms engaging episodic memory, spatial memory and working memory. In addition, we review studies that relate theta reactivity to processes at the interface of memory and language. Despite many unknowns, the experimental evidence largely supports the hypothesis that theta activity plays a functional role in cell assembly formation, a process which may constitute the neural basis of memory formation and retrieval. The available data provide only highly indirect support for the hypothesis that scalp-recorded theta yields information about hippocampal functioning. It is concluded that studying induced rhythmic activity holds promise as an additional important way to study brain function.},

	abstract = {Language comprehension involves two basic operations: the retrieval of lexical information (such as phonologic, syntactic, and semantic information) from long-term memory, and the unification of this information into a coherent representation of the overall utterance. Neuroimaging studies using hemodynamic measures such as PET and fMRI have provided detailed information on which areas of the brain are involved in these language-related memory and unification operations. However, much less is known about the dynamics of the brain's language network. This chapter presents a literature review of the oscillatory neuronal dynamics of EEG and MEG data that can be observed during language comprehension tasks. From a detailed review of this (rapidly growing) literature the following picture emerges: memory retrieval operations are mostly accompanied by increased neuronal synchronization in the theta frequency range (4‚Äì7Hz). Unification operations, in contrast, induce high-frequency neuronal synchronization in the beta (12‚Äì30Hz) and gamma (above 30Hz) frequency bands. A desynchronization in the (upper) alpha frequency band is found for those studies that use secondary tasks, and seems to correspond with attentional processes, and with the behavioral consequences of the language comprehension process. We conclude that it is possible to capture the dynamics of the brain's language network by a careful analysis of the event-related changes in power and coherence of EEG and MEG data in a wide range of frequencies, in combination with subtle experimental manipulations in a range of language comprehension tasks. It appears then that neuronal synchrony is a mechanism by which the brain integrates the different types of information about language (such as phonological, orthographic, semantic, and syntactic information) represented in different brain areas.},

It is increasingly evident that attention is equally crucial for prioritizing representations within WM as the importance of individual items changes. Retrospective prioritization has been proposed to result from a focus of internal attention highlighting one of several representations. Here, we suggest an updated model, in which prioritization acts in multiple steps: first orienting towards and selecting a memory, and then reconfiguring its representational state in the service of upcoming task demands. Reconfiguration sets up an optimized perception-action mapping, obviating the need for sustained attention. This view is consistent with recent literature, makes testable predictions, and links WM with task switching and action preparation.},

Results from longitudinal data collected over 18 mo are reported, presenting counterevidence for recent hypotheses on early L2 acquisition according to which missing functional items reflect missing functional categories. Despite robust evidence for the early production of copula be, auxiliary be, and overt subjects, the child L2 data analyzed in this paper do not show any evidence for tense and agreement morphology in the early stages of L2 development. In other words, although some functional elements related to IP are missing, the learner is able to perform other morphological and syntactic operations involving the functional projection IP. These findings lead us to question whether the lack of functional elements entails the lack of functional categories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The chapter presents a series of experiments on the role of memory in reasoning, language comprehension, and learning. An attempt is made to apply the comparable techniques in all three cases to allow a common pattern to emerge, if the same working memory system is operative in all three instances. The chapter makes a case for postulating the working memory-LTS system as a modification of the current STS-LTS view. Working memory represents a control system with limits on both its storage and processing capabilities, and has access to phonemically coded information (possibly by controlling a rehearsal buffer), that it is responsible for the limited memory span, but does not underlie the recency effect in free recall. The experiments presented in the chapter suggest that the phonemic rehearsal buffer plays a limited role in this process, but is by no means essential. These experiments also suggest that working memory plays a part in verbal reasoning and in prose comprehension. Understanding the detailed role of working memory in these tasks, however, must proceed hand-in-hand with an understanding of the tasks themselves.},

Fifty-nine L1 English, Dutch and Russian advanced to near-native L2 speakers of German were tested on their ultimate attainment of case marking, subject‚Äìverb agreement and gender concord. Different off-line and on-line tasks were employed. Cross-linguistic and cross-experiment comparisons of native and non-native performance show that native-like ultimate attainment of L2 inflection is possible for postpubescent learners in L2 grammar and L2 processing. Non-target-like L2 inflection is systematically related to L1 transfer and limitations in L2 processing efficiency. In conjunction, these findings argue against a critical period for morphosyntax in L2 acquisition; rather, they suggest that non-native and native grammars and processing systems are fundamentally identical, with L2 systems being computationally less efficient due to L1 influence.},

	abstract = {Miller (1956) summarized evidence that people can remember about seven chunks in short-term memory (STM) tasks. However, that number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in analyses of information processing only if the boundary conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when other steps are taken specifically to block the recoding of stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions, rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms that are not capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall. A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks is distinguished from compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the focus of attention is proposed.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews studies on the speed and accuracy of accessing representations of recently processed information. It documents the types of retrieval operations used to access both item and order information. Evidence is presented indicating that item information is retrieved with a direct-access (content-addressable) process, whereas order information is retrieved by a slower serial search process. Crucially, however, in neither case do we find evidence for a qualitative or quantitative "break-point" between what a tripartite architecture posits as the divide between working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM). Collectively, the temporal dynamics of retrieval are indicative of two rather than three representational states. These measures provide clear evidence for a distinction between information within the current focus of attention and information passively stored in memory but not a further distinction corresponding to WM and LTM. Rather, the evidence suggests the type of dichotomy in which there is only an architectural difference between representations in focal attention and representations in memory. The probability of retrieving an item from memory decreases continuously as more information is interpolated between study and test. Here, however, accessibility shows a sharply dichotomous pattern. Items within focal attention are accessed quickly, but all other items outside attention are accessed more slowly and with the same retrieval speed. The second emphasis of the chapter is on the capacity of focal attention. Information in focal attention can be discriminated from information in a more passive state by its relatively fast retrieval dynamics. The chapter ends with a brief discussion of neuroimaging findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {We present a detailed process theory of the moment-by-moment working-memory retrievals and associated control structure that subserve sentence comprehension. The theory is derived from the application of independently motivated principles of memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence parsing. The resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of skilled associative memory retrievals modulated by similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The cognitive principles are formalized in computational form in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) architecture, and our process model is realized in ACT-R. We present the results of 6 sets of simulations: 5 simulation sets provide quantitative accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on both unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of double center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to extremely difficult. The explanation of center-embedding difficulty is a novel one that derives from the model' complete reliance on discriminating retrieval cues in the absence of an explicit representation of serial order information. All fits were obtained with only 1 free scaling parameter fixed across the simulations; all other parameters were ACT-R defaults. The modeling results support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference are the key factors shaping working memory in sentence processing. We contrast the theory and empirical predictions with several related accounts of sentence-processing complexity.},

We describe an emerging theoretical framework for this working memory system that incorporates several independently motivated principles of memory: a sharply limited attentional focus, rapid retrieval of item (but not order) information subject to interference from similar items, and activation decay (forgetting over time). A computational model embodying these principles provides an explanation of the functional capacities and severe limitations of human processing, as well as accounts of reading times. The broad implication is that the detailed nature of crosslinguistic sentence processing emerges from the interaction of general principles of human memory with the specialized task of language comprehension.},

That is, one member of the opposition (e.g. feminine for gender, plural for number) is assumed to be marked, and the other one, unmarked. The present study examines how these asymmetries impact agreement resolution in Spanish. Agreement was manipulated between a noun acting as head of a relative clause and an adjective located inside the relative clause (e.g. catedral que parec√≠a inmensa ‚Äúcathedral that looked huge‚Äù). Half of the nouns were feminine (marked) and the other half, masculine (unmarked). Half of the nouns were used in the plural (marked) and the other half, in the singular (unmarked). Twenty-seven Spanish native speakers read 240 sentences while their brain activity was recorded with electroencephalography and performed a grammaticality judgment. Results showed that both number and gender violations elicited a central-posterior P600, a component associated with syntactic repair, and a late anterior negativity, argued to reflect working memory costs. Only the P600 was affected by markedness. It started earlier for violations where the mismatching feature was marked. Moreover, it was larger for errors where the mismatching feature was marked, although this amplitude modulation only emerged for number, possibly due to differences in how number and gender cues were realized (i.e. both masculine and feminine showed overt inflection, but singular was uninflected relative to plural). These results suggest that the parser is sensitive to markedness asymmetries in the course of online processing.},

	abstract = {The present study uses event-related potentials to examine subject‚Äìverb person agreement in Spanish, with a focus on how markedness with respect to the speech participant status of the subject modulates processing. Morphological theory proposes a markedness distinction between first and second person, on the one hand, and third person on the other. The claim is that both the first and second persons are participants in the speech act, since they play the speaker and addressee roles, respectively. In contrast, third person refers to whomever is neither the speaker nor the addressee (i.e., it is unmarked for person). We manipulated speech participant by probing person agreement with both first-person singular subjects (e.g., yo‚Ä¶lloro ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶cry-1ST PERSON-SG‚Äù) and third-person singular ones (e.g., la viuda‚Ä¶llora ‚Äúthe widow‚Ä¶cry-3RD PERSON-SG‚Äù). We also manipulated agreement by crossing first-person singular subjects with third-person singular verbs (e.g., yo‚Ä¶‚àóllora ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶cry-3RD PERSON-SG‚Äù) and vice versa (e.g., la viuda‚Ä¶‚àólloro ‚Äúthe widow‚Ä¶cry-1ST PERSON-SG‚Äù). Results from 28 native speakers of Spanish revealed robust positivities for both types of person violations, relative to their grammatical counterparts between 500 and 1000 ms, an effect that shows a central-posterior distribution, with a right hemisphere bias. This positivity is consistent with the P600, a component associated with a number of morphosyntactic operations (and reanalysis processes more generally). No negativities emerged before the P600 (between 250 and 450 ms), although both error types yielded an anterior negativity in the P600 time window, an effect that has been argued to reflect the memory costs associated with keeping the errors in working memory to provide a sentence-final judgment. Crucially, person violations with a marked subject (e.g., yo‚Ä¶‚àóllora ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶cry-3RD PERSON-SG‚Äù) yielded a larger P600 than the opposite error type between 700 and 900 ms. This effect is consistent with the possibility that, upon encountering a subject with marked features, feature activation allows the parser to generate a stronger prediction regarding the upcoming verb. The larger P600 for person violations with a marked subject might index the reanalysis process that the parser initiates when there is a conflict between a highly expected verbal form (i.e., more so than in the conditions with an unmarked subject) and the form that is actually encountered.

In order to define suitable search criteria, the expansion of mutual information is utilized as a function of cumulants of increasing orders. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which allows the computation of the ICA of a data matrix within a polynomial time. The concept of ICA may actually be seen as an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines directions that are orthogonal. Potential applications of ICA include data analysis and compression, Bayesian detection, localization of sources, and blind identification and deconvolution.

Die Analyse unabh√§ngiger Komponenten (ICA) eines Vektors beruht auf der Suche nach einer linearen Transformation, die die statistische Abh√§ngigkeit zwischen den Komponenten minimiert. Zur Definition geeigneter Such-Kriterien wird die Entwicklung gemeinsamer Information als Funktion von Kumulanten steigender Ordnung genutzt. Es wird ein effizienter Algorithmus vorgeschlagen, der die Berechnung der ICA f√ºr Datenmatrizen innerhalb einer polynomischen Zeit erlaubt. Das Konzept der ICA kann eigentlich als Erweiterung der ‚ÄòPrincipal Component Analysis‚Äò (PCA) betrachtet werden, die nur die Unabh√§ngigkeit bis zur zweiten Ordnung erzwingen kann und deshalb Richtungen definiert, die orthogonal sind. Potentielle Anwendungen der ICA beinhalten Daten-Analyse und Kompression, Bayes-Detektion, Quellenlokalisierung und blinde Identifikation und Entfaltung.

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing.},

	abstract = {Chemoautotrophic production in seafloor hydrothermal systems has the potential to provide an important source of organic carbon that is exported to the surrounding deep-ocean. While hydrothermal plumes may export carbon, entrained from chimney walls and biologically rich diffuse flow areas, away from sites of venting they also have the potential to provide an environment for in-situ carbon fixation. In this study, we have followed the fate of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) as it is dispersed through and settles beneath a hydrothermal plume system at 9¬∞50‚Ä≤N on the East Pacific Rise. Concentrations of both DOC and POC are elevated in buoyant plume samples that were collected directly above sites of active venting using both DSV Alvin and a CTD-rosette. Similar levels of POC enrichment are also observed in the dispersing non-buoyant plume, ‚àº500m downstream from the vent-site. Further, sediment-trap samples collected beneath the same dispersing plume system, show evidence for a close coupling between organic carbon and Fe oxyhydroxide fluxes. We propose, therefore, a process that concentrates POC into hydrothermal plumes as they disperse through the deep-ocean. This is most probably the result of some combination of preferential adsorption of organic carbon onto Fe-oxyhydroxides and/or microbial activity that preferentially concentrates organic carbon in association with Fe-oxyhydroxides (e.g. through the microbial oxidation of Fe(II) and Fe sulfides). This potential for biological production and consumption within hydrothermal plumes highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to understanding the role of the carbon cycle in deep-sea hydrothermal systems as well as the role that hydrothermal systems may play in regulating global deep-ocean carbon budgets.},

To date, despite the importance of neural oscillations in language comprehension, the neural-oscillatory dynamics of sentence encoding are only sparsely understood. Although oscillations in a wide range of frequency bands have been reported both for the encoding of unstructured word lists and for working-memory intensive sentences, it is unclear to what extent these frequency bands subserve processes specific to the working-memory component of sentence comprehension or to general verbal working memory. In our auditory electroencephalography study, we isolated the working-memory component of sentence comprehension by adapting a subsequent memory paradigm to sentence comprehension and assessing oscillatory power changes during successful sentence encoding. Time-frequency analyses and source reconstruction revealed alpha-power desynchronization in left-hemispheric language-relevant regions during successful sentence encoding. We further showed that sentence encoding was more successful when source-level alpha-band desynchronization aligned with computational measures of syntactic-compared to lexical-semantic-difficulty. Our results are a preliminary indication of a domain-general mechanism of cortical disinhibition via alpha-band desynchronization superimposed onto the language-relevant cortex, which is beneficial for encoding sentences into working memory.},

	abstract = {Syntactically and semantically anomalous words encountered during sentence comprehension are known to elicit dissociable electrophysiological responses, which are thought to reflect distinct aspects of language processing. However, the sources of these responses have not been well characterized. We used beamforming analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to map generators of electrophysiological responses to linguistic anomalies. Anomalous words occurred in the context of a sentence acceptability judgement task conducted in both visual and auditory modalities. Time‚Äìfrequency analysis revealed that both kinds of violations elicited event-related synchronization (ERS) in the delta‚Äìtheta frequency range (1‚Äì5Hz), and desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha‚Äìbeta range (8‚Äì30Hz). In addition, these responses were differentially modulated by violation type and presentation modality. 1‚Äì5Hz responses were consistently localized within medial prefrontal cortex and did not vary significantly across violation types, but were stronger for visual presentation. In contrast, 8‚Äì30Hz ERD occurred in different regions for different violation types. For semantic violations the distribution was predominantly in the bilateral occipital cortex and left temporal and inferior frontal regions, and these effects did not differ for visual and auditory presentation. In contrast, syntactic responses were strongly affected by presentation modality. Under visual presentation, syntactic violations elicited bilateral 8‚Äì30Hz ERD extending into dorsal parietal and frontal regions, whereas effects were much weaker and mostly statistically insignificant in the auditory modality. These results suggest that delta‚Äìtheta ERS reflects generalized increases in working memory demands related to linguistic anomaly detection, while alpha‚Äìbeta ERD reflects specific activation of cortical regions involved in distinct aspects of linguistic processing, such as semantic vs. phonological short-term memory. Beamforming analysis of time-domain average signals (ERFs) revealed an N400m effect for semantic anomalies in both modalities, localized to left superior temporal and posterior frontal regions, and a later P600-like effect for syntactic anomalies in both modalities, widespread over bilateral frontal, posterior temporal, and parietal regions. These results indicate that time-domain averaged responses and induced oscillatory responses have distinct properties, including localization and modality dependence, and likely reflect dissociable and complementary aspects of neural activity related to language comprehension and additional task-related processes.},

	abstract = {Patients with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) may react to linguistic stimuli differently than healthy controls, reflecting degeneration of language networks and engagement of compensatory mechanisms. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to evaluate oscillatory neural responses in sentence comprehension, in patients with PPA and age-matched controls. Participants viewed sentences containing semantically and syntactically anomalous words that evoke distinct oscillatory responses. For age-matched controls, semantic anomalies elicited left-lateralized 8‚Äì30‚ÄØHz power decreases distributed along ventral brain regions, whereas syntactic anomalies elicited bilateral power decreases in both ventral and dorsal regions. In comparison to controls, patients with PPA showed altered patterns of induced oscillations, characterized by delayed latencies and attenuated amplitude, which were correlated with linguistic impairment measured offline. The recruitment of right hemisphere temporo-parietal areas (also found in controls) was correlated with preserved semantic processing abilities, indicating that preserved neural activity in these regions was able to support successful semantic processing. In contrast, syntactic processing was more consistently impaired in PPA, regardless of neural activity patterns, suggesting that this domain of language is particularly vulnerable to the neuronal loss. In addition, we found that delayed peak latencies of oscillatory responses were associated with lower accuracy for detecting semantic anomalies, suggesting that language deficits observed in PPA may be linked to delayed or slowed information processing.,

Understanding how much permafrost carbon will be released, over what time frame, and what the relative emissions of carbon dioxide and methane will be is key for understanding the impact on global climate. In addition, the response of vegetation in a warming climate has the potential to offset at least some of the accelerating feedback to the climate from permafrost carbon. Temperature, organic carbon, and ground ice are key regulators for determining the impact of permafrost ecosystems on the global carbon cycle. Together, these encompass services of permafrost relevant to global society as well as to the people living in the region and help to determine the landscape-level response of this region to a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Naturally occurring gas hydrates may contribute to a positive feedback for global warming because they sequester large amounts of the potent greenhouse gas methane in ice-like deposits that could be destabilized by increasing ocean/atmospheric temperatures. Most hydrates occur within marine sediments; gas liberated during the decomposition of seafloor hydrates or originating with other methane pools can feed methane emissions at cold seeps. Regardless of the origin of seep methane, all previous measurements of methane emitted from seeps have shown it to have a unique fossil radiocarbon signature, contrasting with other sources of marine methane. Here we present the concentration and natural radiocarbon content of methane dissolved in the water column from the seafloor to the sea surface at seep fields along the US Atlantic and Pacific margins. For shallower water columns, where the seafloor is not within the hydrate stability zone, we do document seep CH4 in some surface-water samples. However, measurements in deeper water columns along the US Atlantic margin reveal no evidence of seep CH4 reaching surface waters when the water-column depth is greater than 430‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ90‚Äâm. Gas hydrates exist only at water depths greater than {\textasciitilde}550‚Äâm in this region, suggesting that the source of methane escaping to the atmosphere is not from hydrate decomposition.},

However, ESI FT-ICR MS generally has poor repeatability and reproducibility because of its inherent ionization mechanism and structural characteristics, which severely hindered its application in quantitative analysis of complex mixtures. In this article, we developed an in-house standard method for molecular characterization of DOM by ESI FT-ICR MS. Instead of obtaining reproducible results by determining the instrument parameters, we adopted an approach of object control on the mass spectrum to solve the problem of poor reproducibility. The mass peak shape, resolution, and relative intensity distribution of a natural organic matter standard were adjusted by optimizing the operating conditions to obtain a repeatable result. The quality control sample was run 26 times by the different operators in a 6-month-long period to evaluate the reproducibility. Results showed that the relative standard deviation (\%) of repeatability and reproducibility are 1.02 and 2.35 for average H/C, respectively. The in-house standard method has been validated and successfully used for the characterization of more than 4000 DOM samples, which is transferable to other laboratories.},

	abstract = {The first carbon budget constructed for the Barents Sea to study the fluxes of carbon into, out of, and within the region is presented. The budget is based on modelled volume flows, measured dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration, and literature values for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations. The results of the budget show that ‚àº5600¬±660√ó106tCyr‚àí1 is exchanged through the boundaries of the Barents Sea. If a 40\% uncertainty in the volume flows is included in the error calculation it resulted in a total uncertainty of ¬±1600√ó106tCyr‚àí1. The largest part of the total budget flux consists of DIC advection (‚àº95\% of the inflow and ‚àº97\% of the outflow). The other sources and sinks are, in order of importance, advection of organic carbon (DOC+POC; ‚àº3\% of both in- and outflow), total uptake of atmospheric CO2 (‚àº1\% of the inflow), river and land sources (‚àº0.2\% of the inflow), and burial of organic carbon in the sediments (‚àº0.2\% of the outflow). The Barents Sea is a net exporter of carbon to the Arctic Ocean; the net DIC export is ‚àº2500¬±660√ó106tCyr‚àí1 of which ‚àº1700¬±650√ó106tCyr‚àí1 (‚àº70\%) is in subsurface water masses and thus sequestered from the atmosphere. The net total organic carbon export to the Arctic Ocean is ‚àº80¬±20√ó106tCyr‚àí1. Shelf pumping in the Barents Sea results in an uptake of ‚àº22¬±11√ó106tCyr‚àí1 from the atmosphere which is exported out of the area in the dense modified Atlantic Waters.

Yet, our currently limited understanding of the Arctic Ocean carbon cycle hinders our ability to predict how changing conditions will affect local Arctic ecosystems, regional carbon budgets, and global climate. We present here the first set of concurrent, full-depth, dual-isotope profiles for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and suspended particulate organic carbon (POCsusp) at two sites in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean. The carbon isotope composition of sinking and suspended POC in the Arctic contrasts strongly with open ocean Atlantic and Pacific sites, pointing to a combination of inputs to Arctic POCsusp at depth, including surface-derived organic carbon (OC), sorbed/advected OC, and OC derived from in situ DIC fixation. The latter process appears to be particularly important at intermediate depths, where mass balance calculations suggest that OC derived from in situ DIC fixation contributes up to 22\% of POCsusp. As in other oceans, surface-derived OC is still a dominant source to Arctic POCsusp. Yet, we suggest that significantly smaller vertical POC fluxes in the Canada Basin make it possible to see evidence of DIC fixation in the POCsusp pool even at the bulk isotope level.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Each spring and summer, the Chukchi Sea in the western Arctic Ocean experiences a short but intense phytoplankton bloom that is controlled by sea ice cover, nutrient availability, and river runoff. During the bloom, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations are drawn down in the mixed layer (shelf, Œî100 ¬µmol kg‚àí1; shelf-break, Œî50 ¬µmol kg‚àí1; basin, {\textless}Œî5 ¬µmol kg‚àí1) and converted to particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We use Œ¥18O and salinity to estimate DOC inputs by river and sea ice melt, allowing the marine portion of the DOC pool to be compared between seasons and to facilitate estimates of net DOC production in the region. We estimate that 10\% of the DIC consumed during net community production is converted to DOC. The remaining carbon deficit (90\% of DIC drawdown) is most likely exported from the mixed layer as POC. In 2002 a carbon (C) mass balance was developed for the Chukchi Sea that showed that rates of vertical export were highest over the Chukchi Shelf near Point Barrow (64 mmol C m‚àí d‚àí1), but more commonly ranged from 10 to 35 mmol C m‚àí d‚àí1 over the remainder of the shelf. At the shelf-break and in the Canada Basin export production was {\textless}10 mmol C m‚àí d‚àí1. DOC plays a relatively small role as a carbon sink in the system, but quantifying its contributions provides more robust estimates of export production in the Arctic.},

The Nansen, Amundsen, and Makarov Basins were characterized by the influence of Atlantic water and the fluvial discharge of the Siberian rivers with high concentrations of terrigenous DOM (tDOM). The Canada Basin and the Chukchi Sea were characterized by Pacific water, modified through contact with productive shelf sediments with elevated levels of marine DOM. Within the surface layer of the Beaufort Gyre, meteoric water (river water and precipitation) was characterized by low concentrations of lignin and terrigenous DOM fluorescence proxies as DOM is removed during freezing. High-resolution in situ fluorescence profiles revealed that DOM distribution closely followed isopycnals, indicating the strong influence of sea-ice formation and melt, which was also reflected in strong correlations between DOM fluorescence and brine contributions. The relationship of DOM and hydrography to TEs showed that terrigenous and marine DOM were likely carriers of dissolved Fe, Ni, Cu from the Eurasian shelves into the central Arctic Ocean. Chukchi shelf sediments were important sources of dCd, dZn, and dNi, as well as marine ligands that bind and carry these TEs offshore within the upper halocline (UHC) in the Canada Basin. Our data suggest that tDOM components represent stronger ligands relative to marine DOM components, potentially facilitating the long-range transport of TE to the North Atlantic.},

The hydrothermal plume emanating from Aurora exhibits much higher dissolved CH4/Mn values than typical basalt-hosted hydrothermal systems and, instead, closely resembles those of high-temperature ultramafic-influenced vents at slow-spreading ridges. We hypothesize that deep-penetrating fluid circulation may have sustained the prolonged venting evident at the Aurora hydrothermal field with a hydrothermal convection cell that can access ultramafic lithologies underlying anomalously thin ocean crust at this ultraslow spreading ridge setting. Our findings have implications for ultra-slow ridge cooling, global marine mineral distributions, and the diversity of geologic settings that can host abiotic organic synthesis - pertinent to the search for life beyond Earth.},

	abstract = {The origin of modern seafloor methane emissions in the Barents Sea is tightly connected to the glacio-tectonic and oceanographic transformations following the last ice age. Those regional events induced geological structure re-activation and destabilization of gas hydrate reservoirs over large areas of the European continental margins, sustaining widespread fluid plumbing systems. Despite the increasing number of new active seep discoveries, their accurate geochronology and paleo-dynamic is still poorly resolved, thus hindering precise identification of triggering factors and mechanisms controlling past and future seafloor emissions. Here, we report the distribution, petrographic (thin section, electron backscatter diffraction), isotopic (Œ¥13C, Œ¥18O) and lipid biomarker composition of methane-derived carbonates collected from Leirdjupet Fault Complex, SW Barents Sea, at 300¬†m depth during an ROV survey in 2021. Carbonates are located inside a 120 x 220¬†m elongated pockmark and form {\textless}10¬†m2 bodies protruding for about 2¬†m above the adjacent seafloor. Microstructural analyses of vein-filling cements showed the occurrence of three‚Äìfive generations of isopachous aragonitic cement separated by dissolution surfaces indicative of intermittent oxidizing conditions. The integration of phase-specific isotopic analysis and U/Th dating showed Œ¥13C values between ‚àí28.6‚Ä∞ to ‚àí10.1‚Ä∞ and Œ¥18O between 4.6‚Ä∞ and 5.3‚Ä∞, enabling us to track carbonate mineral precipitation over the last ‚àº8¬†ka. Lipid biomarkers and their compound-specific Œ¥13C analysis in the bulk carbonate revealed the presence of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea of the ANME-2 clade associated with sulfate-reducing bacteria of the Seep-SRB1 clade, as well as traces of petroleum. Our results indicate that methane and petroleum seepage in this area followed a similar evolution as in other southernmost Barents Sea sites controlled by the asynchronous deglaciation of the Barents Sea shelf, and that methane-derived carbonate precipitation is still an active process at many Arctic locations.},

To this end, a recently developed stable isotope-assisted LC‚ÄìHRMS-based metabolomics workflow for the global annotation of biological samples has been further developed and extended. For untargeted detection of metabolites arising from labeled tracer substances, isotope pattern recognition has been adjusted to account for nonlabeled moieties conjugated to the native and labeled tracer molecules. Furthermore, the workflow has been extended by (i) an optional ion intensity ratio check, (ii) the automated combination of positive and negative ionization mode mass spectra derived from fast polarity switching, and (iii) metabolic feature annotation. These extensions enable the automated, unbiased, and global detection of tracer-derived metabolites in complex biological samples. The workflow is demonstrated with the metabolism of 13C9-phenylalanine in wheat cell suspension cultures in the presence of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). In total, 341 metabolic features (150 in positive and 191 in negative ionization mode) corresponding to 139 metabolites were detected. The benefit of fast polarity switching was evident, with 32 and 58 of these metabolites having exclusively been detected in the positive and negative modes, respectively. Moreover, for 19 of the remaining 49 phenylalanine-derived metabolites, the assignment of ion species and, thus, molecular weight was possible only by the use of complementary features of the two ion polarity modes. Statistical evaluation showed that treatment with DON increased or decreased the abundances of many detected metabolites.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean accounts for nearly 662‚ÄØPg of carbon, most of which is formed into a long-lived carbon pool that plays an important role in carbon sequestration. This carbon resists rapid biological decomposition and is widely known as recalcitrant DOM (RDOM). The recalcitrant nature of deep-sea DOM has been addressed for more than half of a century, studies examining the chemical composition, production, distribution, and removal of RDOM are progressively increasing in recent decades and could add to our understanding of its cycling; however, they need to be better synthesized. A concept proposed over a decade ago, the microbial carbon pump (MCP), attributes the main mechanism of RDOM formation to successive microbial processing of organic matter. This ultimately leads to inaccessibility due to the intrinsic recalcitrant nature of DOM under certain environmental conditions, or to the organic concentration falling below the threshold for microbial reutilization, further explaining the recalcitrant nature of RDOM. This review focuses on those DOM molecules with intrinsic recalcitrant nature and collates studies on the following three aspects: (i) proxies of intrinsic RDOM, (ii) ecological processes that affect RDOM production within the conceptual framework of the MCP, and (iii) distribution and removal processes of RDOM in the ocean. Throughout this extensive review, we examine the vital role of microbes in the production and maintenance of RDOM in the ocean and conclude that the MCP is essentially associated with the sequestration of RDOM in the ocean.},

Understanding how much permafrost carbon will be released, over what time frame, and what the relative emissions of carbon dioxide and methane will be is key for understanding the impact on global climate. In addition, the response of vegetation in a warming climate has the potential to offset at least some of the accelerating feedback to the climate from permafrost carbon. Temperature, organic carbon, and ground ice are key regulators for determining the impact of permafrost ecosystems on the global carbon cycle. Together, these encompass services of permafrost relevant to global society as well as to the people living in the region and help to determine the landscape-level response of this region to a changing climate.},

	abstract = {The ocean is a salty and very diluted broth of organic matter that contains about 680 Pg C. More than 97\% of this organic matter is in the dissolved form. This huge amount of reduced carbon, comparable to the CO2 accumulated in the atmosphere, results in an average concentration of 0.48¬†ppm (or 40.3¬†Œºmol¬†kg‚àí1) when divided by the world ocean volume. Comparatively, salts add up to about 35,000¬†ppm. Low concentrations, extreme complexity of an organic matrix formed by myriads of compounds and vast interferences with the salt matrix are the main challenges associated with the accurate determination of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the marine environment. In this chapter we aim to provide a useful overview of the procedures to effectively sample (‚Äúclean lab‚Äù protocols), process (filtration, ultrafiltration, solid-phase extraction), preserve (acidification, freezing, freeze-drying) and analyse the bulk DOM pool. Analytical methods for the characterization of its elemental (C, N, P), optical (absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy) and emerging molecular property (FT-ICR-MS, NMR) composition will be described. Out of the scope of this chapter is the determination of individual compounds (e.g. amino acids, carbohydrates) as well as the isotope characterization of DOM.},

I here analyze ocean alkalinization in a high CO2 world (emission scenario SSP5-85-EXT++ and CDR-ocean-alk within CDRMIP) for the next millennia using a revised version of the carbon cycle model BICYCLE, whose long-term feedbacks are calculated for the next 1 million years. The applied model version not only captures atmosphere, ocean, and a constant marine and terrestrial biosphere, but also represents solid Earth processes, such as deep ocean CaCO3 accumulation and dissolution, volcanic CO2 outgassing, and continental weathering. In the applied negative emission experiment, 0.14 Pmol/yr of alkalinity‚Äîcomparable to the dissolution of 5 Pg of olivine per year‚Äîis entering the surface ocean starting in year 2020 for either 50 or 5000 years. I find that the cumulative emissions of 6,740 PgC emitted until year 2350 lead to a peak atmospheric CO2 concentration of nearly 2,400 ppm in year 2326, which is reduced by only 200 ppm by the alkalinization experiment. Atmospheric CO2 is brought down to 400 or 300 ppm after 2730 or 3480 years of alkalinization, respectively. Such low CO2 concentrations are reached without ocean alkalinization only after several hundreds of thousands of years, when the feedbacks from weathering and sediments bring the part of the anthropogenic emissions that stays in the atmosphere (the so-called airborne fraction) below 4\%. The efficiency of carbon sequestration by this alkalinization approach peaks at 9.7 PgC per Pmol of alkalinity added during times of maximum anthropogenic CO2 emissions and slowly declines to half this value 2000 years later due to the non-linear marine chemistry response and ocean-sediment processes. In other words, ocean alkalinization sequesters carbon only as long as the added alkalinity stays in the ocean. To understand the basic model behavior, I analytically explain why in the simulation results a linear relationship in the transient climate response (TCR) to cumulative emissions is found for low emissions (similarly as for more complex climate models), which evolves for high emissions to a non-linear relation.},

	abstract = {The existence of stabilizing feedbacks within Earth's climate system is generally thought to be necessary for the persistence of liquid water and life. Over the course of Earth's history, Earth's atmospheric composition appears to have adjusted to the gradual increase in solar luminosity, resulting in persistently habitable surface temperatures. With limited exceptions, the Earth system has been observed to recover rapidly from pulsed climatic perturbations. Carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation via negative feedbacks within the coupled global carbon-silica cycles are classically viewed as the main processes giving rise to climate stability on Earth. Here we review the long-term global carbon cycle budget, and how the processes modulating Earth's climate system have evolved over time. Specifically, we focus on the relative roles that shifts in carbon sources and sinks have played in driving long-term changes in atmospheric pCO2. We make the case that marine processes are an important component of the canonical silicate weathering feedback, and have played a much more important role in pCO2 regulation than traditionally imagined. Notably, geochemical evidence indicate that the weathering of marine sediments and off-axis basalt alteration act as major carbon sinks. However, this sink was potentially dampened during Earth's early history when oceans had higher levels of dissolved silicon (Si), iron (Fe), and magnesium (Mg), and instead likely fostered more extensive carbon recycling within the ocean-atmosphere system via reverse weathering‚Äîthat in turn acted to elevate ocean-atmosphere CO2 levels.},

	volume = {2012},
	abstract = {Arctic sea ice is melting rapidly, and within the next decade polar warming may transform the region from an inaccessible frozen desert into a seasonally navigable ocean. The debate over Arctic shipping routes routinely revolves around the Northwest Passage (NWP) and the Northern Sea Route (NSR), but neglects to make mention of the Transpolar Sea Route (TSR). In the 20th century the use of Polar routes revolutionized international air travel. In similar fashion, the TSR bears the potential to transform the international commercial shipping industry in the 21st century. The authors will discuss the potential of the TSR as a future corridor of commercial shipping and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the climatic, legal, economic, and geopolitical context. The article will examine the feasibility of the TSR with respect to the continued decline of Arctic sea ice and analyze the economic potential of the route and its compatibility with existing trade patterns. The authors will also discuss the TSR's special status as the only Arctic shipping route outside of national territorial jurisdiction. Special emphasis will be given to China's emerging interest in Arctic shipping and its growing economic relationship with Iceland, which stands to gain massively if it were to develop into a transpolar shipping hub. The opening and future development of Arctic shipping routes will not only depend on favorable climatic conditions across the Arctic Ocean, but will also be influenced by a shift in economic and political spheres of influence. The development of the TSR and its significant economic potential may thus in part be determined by key geostrategic considerations as the center of economic and political power continues to shift towards Asia. This multi-faceted and interdisciplinary study aims to outline and elaborate on a range of key issues and challenges related to the future of the TSR.},

Whether aridification leads to gradual (versus abrupt) and systemic (versus specific) ecosystem changes is largely unknown. We investigated how 20 structural and functional ecosystem attributes respond to aridity in global drylands. Aridification led to systemic and abrupt changes in multiple ecosystem attributes. These changes occurred sequentially in three phases characterized by abrupt decays in plant productivity, soil fertility, and plant cover and richness at aridity values of 0.54, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively. More than 20\% of the terrestrial surface will cross one or several of these thresholds by 2100, which calls for immediate actions to minimize the negative impacts of aridification on essential ecosystem services for the more than 2 billion people living in drylands.},

	abstract = {Recent research has focused on the changing ability of oceans to absorb atmospheric CO2 and the consequences for ocean acidification, with Arctic shelf seas being among the most sensitive regions. Hudson Bay is a large shelf sea in northern Canada whose location at the margin of the cryosphere places it in the vanguard of global climate change. Here, we develop a four-compartment box-model and carbon budget using published and recently collected measurements to estimate carbon inputs, transformations, and losses within Hudson Bay. We estimate the annual effects of terrestrial carbon remineralization on aragonite saturation (Œ©Ar, a proxy for ocean acidification) and on the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2, a proxy for air-sea CO2 flux) within each compartment, as well as the effects of marine primary production, marine organic carbon remineralization, and terrestrial calcium carbonate dissolution. We find that the remineralization of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon is the main driver of CO2 accumulation and aragonite under-saturation in coastal surface waters, but this is largely offset by marine primary production. Below the surface mixed layer, marine organic carbon remineralization is the largest contributor to CO2 accumulation and aragonite under-saturation, and is partially offset by terrestrial CaCO3 dissolution. Overall, the annual delivery and processing of carbon reduces Œ©Ar of water flowing through HB by up to 0.17 units and raises pCO2 by up to 165 ¬µatm. The similarities between Hudson Bay and other Arctic shelf seas suggest these areas are also significantly influenced by terrestrial carbon inputs and transformation.},

Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed ‚Äòapparent‚Äô temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate.},

We found emergence timescales that ranged from less than a decade to more than a century, a consequence of the time lag between the chemical and radiative impacts of rising atmospheric CO2 on the ocean. Processes sensitive to carbonate chemical changes emerge rapidly, such as the impacts of acidification on the calcium carbonate pump (10 years for the globally integrated signal and 9‚Äì18 years for regionally integrated signals) and the invasion flux of anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean (14 years globally and 13‚Äì26 years regionally).

Because of its enormous size and relatively rapid exchange of carbon with the atmosphere, the ocean controls atmospheric CO2 concentration and thereby Earth's climate on timescales of tens to thousands of years. This review examines the basic functions of the ocean's carbon cycle, demonstrating that the ocean carbon inventory is determined primarily by the mass of the ocean, by the chemical speciation of CO2 in seawater, and by the action of the solubility and biological pumps that draw carbon into the ocean's deeper layers, where it can be sequestered for decades to millennia. The ocean also plays a critical role in moderating the impacts of climate change by absorbing an amount of carbon equivalent to about 25\% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the past several decades. However, this also leads to ocean acidification and reduces the chemical buffering capacity of the ocean and its future ability to take up CO2. This review closes with a look at the uncertain future of the ocean carbon cycle and the scientific challenges that this uncertainty brings.},

The ice cover kept sea surface pCO2 at levels lower relative to other ocean basins that have been exposed year round to ever increasing atmospheric levels. In this study, we evaluate sea surface pCO2 measurements collected over a 6-year period along a fixed cruise track in the Canada Basin. The measurements show that mean pCO2 levels are significantly higher during low ice years. The pCO2 increase is likely driven by ocean surface heating and uptake of atmospheric CO2 with large interannual variability in the contributions of these processes. These findings suggest that increased ice-free periods will further increase sea surface pCO2, reducing the Canada Basin's current role as a net sink of atmospheric CO2.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTThe Arctic Ocean is a potentially important sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) with a recent estimate suggesting that the region contributes from 5 to 14\% of the global ocean's net uptake of CO‚ÇÇ. In the western Arctic Ocean, the focus of this paper, the Chukchi Sea is a strong ocean sink for CO‚ÇÇ that is partially compensated for by outgassing of CO‚ÇÇ from the East Siberian Sea shelf. The Arctic marine carbon cycle and exchange of CO‚ÇÇ between the ocean and atmosphere appear particularly sensitive to environmental changes, including sea ice loss, warming, changes in seasonal marine phytoplankton primary production, changes in ocean circulation and freshwater inputs, and even the impacts of ocean acidification. In the near term, further sea ice loss, increases in phytoplankton growth rates, and other environmental and physical changes in the Arctic are expected to cause a limited net increase in the uptake of CO‚ÇÇ by Arctic surface waters. Recent studies suggest that this enhanced uptake will be short lived, with surface waters rapidly warming and equilibrating with the atmosphere. Furthermore, release of large stores of carbon from the surrounding Arctic landmasses through rivers into the Arctic Ocean and further warming over the next century may alter the Arctic from a CO‚ÇÇ sink to a source over the next century},

	abstract = {With increased anthropogenic CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, climate feedbacks could potentially reduce further uptake of carbon by the oceans. The most significant feedbacks acting on the system to reduce carbon sequestration by the oceans are reductions in the thermohaline circulation (THC) and increased sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Although changes in SSTs affect the solubility of atmospheric CO2 across the ocean‚Äêatmosphere interface, changes to the THC lead to more fundamental modifications of the ocean circulation and hence transport and storage of carbon to the deep ocean. Using a coupled model of intermediate complexity which incorporates a carbon solubility pump, we project atmospheric CO2 levels under global warming scenarios. A transient weakening of the THC is found in most simulations and increased SSTs are found in all simulations. Although these positive feedbacks act on the carbon system to reduce oceanic uptake, the ocean has the capacity to take up 65‚Äì75\% of the anthropogenic CO2 increase once the forcing is turned off. This reduces by about 5\% for each 50‚Äêyear period that anthropogenic emissions are maintained at a stabilized and elevated atmospheric CO2 level, and converges to zero if the system is forced with stabilized levels well into the future. The effects of climate feedbacks on carbon uptake are also examined and we find that the ocean stores 7\% more carbon when there are no climate feedbacks acting on the system. Sensitivity experiments are conducted with respect to the representation of ocean mixing and sea‚Äêice dynamics. The inclusion of the Gent‚ÄêMcWilliams parametrization for mixing associated with mesoscale eddies leads to a further 6\% increase in oceanic uptake, whereas the inclusion of sea‚Äêice dynamics only leads to a 2\% variation in global uptake.},

Ocean carbon-cycle models used in calculating these scenarios assume that oceanic circulation and biology remain unchanged through time. Here we examine the importance of this assumption by using a coupled atmosphere‚Äìocean model of global warming5 for the period 1765 to 2065. We find a large potential modification to the ocean carbon sink in a vast region of the Southern Ocean where increased rainfall leads to surface freshening and increased stratification6. The increased stratification reduces the downward flux of carbon and the loss of heat to the atmosphere, both of which decrease the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 relative to a constant-climate control scenario. Changes in the formation, transport and cycling of biological material may counteract the reduced uptake, but the response of the biological community to the climate change is difficult to predict on present understanding. Our simulation suggests that such physical and biological changes might already be occurring, and that they could substantially affect the ocean carbon sink over the next few decades.},

	abstract = {Modelers of global ocean biogeochemistry are beginning to represent a phenomenon that biologists have long observed in laboratory and field settings: that the elemental stoichiometry of phytoplankton is quite flexible. Today, it is well recognized that the C:N:P ratio in phytoplankton and particulate organic matter can vary substantially on ocean basin scales. Recent data show that, compared to the traditional Redfield ratio C:N:P = 106:16:1, the ratio is much higher in the oligotrophic subtropical gyres ({\textasciitilde}195:28:1) and much lower in eutrophic polar waters ({\textasciitilde}78:13:1). This pattern of variability, informed by results from phytoplankton incubation experiments, indicates that environmental factors such as nutrient availability and temperature are important drivers. Our model simulations of the global ocean carbon cycle under global warming and glacial conditions suggest that phytoplankton physiology and community composition control global C:N:P export. Model results also indicate the important role that Southern Ocean sea ice plays in determining the global export stoichiometry by altering the proportional contribution of Southern Ocean phytoplankton to global production. Sea ice retreat under warming and expansion under glaciation, while opposite in sign, can both elevate the global export C:N:P ratio by altering phytoplankton physiology and community composition in contrasting ways between each scenario. The global mean export C:N:P ratio increases from 113:16:1 in the control run to 119:17:1 by the year 2100 in the future run and to 140:16:1 in the glacial run. The impact of higher export C:N:P ratios is to strongly buffer carbon export against change for both scenarios.},

The model is forced by emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse agents from scenarios recently developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and by CO2 stabilization profiles. The uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the ocean is reduced between 7 to 10\% by year 2100 compared to simulations without global warming. The reduction is of similar size in the Southern Ocean and in low-latitude regions (32.5¬∞S-32.5¬∞N) until 2100, whereas low-latitude regions dominate on longer time scales. In the North Atlantic the CO2 uptake is enhanced, unless the Atlantic thermohaline circulation completely collapses. At high latitudes, biologically mediated changes enhance ocean CO2 uptake, whereas in low-latitude regions the situation is reversed. Different implementations of the marine biosphere yield a range of 5 to 16\% for the total reduction in oceanic CO2 uptake until year 2100. Modeled oceanic O2 inventories are significantly reduced in global warming simulations. This suggests that the terrestrial carbon sink deduced from atmospheric O2/N2 observations is potentially overestimated if the oceanic loss of O2 to the atmosphere is not considered.},

	abstract = {Climate change involves a direct response of the climate system to forcing which is amplified or damped by feedbacks operating in the climate system. Carbon-cycle feedbacks alter the land and ocean carbon inventories and so act to reduce or enhance the increase in atmospheric CO2 from carbon emissions. The prevailing framework for carbon-cycle feedbacks connect changes in land and ocean carbon inventories with a linear sum of dependencies on atmospheric CO2 and surface temperature. Carbon-cycle responses and feedbacks provide competing contributions: the dominant effect is that increasing atmospheric CO2 acts to enhance the land and ocean carbon stores, so providing a negative response and feedback to the original increase in atmospheric CO2, while rising surface temperature acts to reduce the land and ocean carbon stores, so providing a weaker positive feedback for atmospheric CO2. The carbon response and feedback of the land and ocean system may be expressed in terms of a combined carbon response and feedback parameter, Œªcarbon in units of W m‚àí‚Äâ2K‚àí‚Äâ1, and is linearly related to the physical climate feedback parameter, Œªclimate, revealing how carbon and climate responses and feedbacks are inter-connected. The magnitude and uncertainties in the carbon-cycle response and feedback parameter are comparable with the magnitude and uncertainties in the climate feedback parameter from clouds. Further mechanistic insight needs to be gained into how the carbon-cycle feedbacks are controlled for the land and ocean, particularly to separate often competing effects from changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate forcing.},

	abstract = {On 103- to 106-year timescales, global sea level is determined largely by the volume of ice stored on land, which in turn largely reflects the thermal state of the Earth system. Here we use observations from five well-studied time slices covering the last 40 My to identify a well-defined and clearly sigmoidal relationship between atmospheric CO2 and sea level on geological (near-equilibrium) timescales. This strongly supports the dominant role of CO2 in determining Earth‚Äôs climate on these timescales and suggests that other variables that influence long-term global climate (e.g., topography, ocean circulation) play a secondary role. The relationship between CO2 and sea level we describe portrays the ‚Äúlikely‚Äù (68\% probability) long-term sea-level response after Earth system adjustment over many centuries. Because it appears largely independent of other boundary condition changes, it also may provide useful long-range predictions of future sea level. For instance, with CO2 stabilized at 400‚Äì450 ppm (as required for the frequently quoted ‚Äúacceptable warming‚Äù of 2 ¬∞C), or even at AD 2011 levels of 392 ppm, we infer a likely (68\% confidence) long-term sea-level rise of more than 9 m above the present. Therefore, our results imply that to avoid significantly elevated sea level in the long term, atmospheric CO2 should be reduced to levels similar to those of preindustrial times.},

	abstract = {The Ekman dynamics of the ocean surface circulation is known to contain attracting regions such as the great oceanic gyres and the associated garbage patches. Less well-known are the extents of the basins of attractions of these regions and how strongly attracting they are. Understanding the shape and extent of the basins of attraction sheds light on the question of the strength of connectivity of different regions of the ocean, which helps in understanding the flow of buoyant material like plastic litter. Using short flow time trajectory data from a global ocean model, we create a Markov chain model of the surface ocean dynamics. The surface ocean is not a conservative dynamical system as water in the ocean follows three-dimensional pathways, with upwelling and downwelling in certain regions. Using our Markov chain model, we easily compute net surface upwelling and downwelling, and verify that it matches observed patterns of upwelling and downwelling in the real ocean. We analyze the Markov chain to determine multiple attracting regions. Finally, using an eigenvector approach, we (i) identify the five major ocean garbage patches, (ii) partition the ocean into basins of attraction for each of the garbage patches, and (iii) partition the ocean into regions that demonstrate transient dynamics modulo the attracting garbage patches.},

	abstract = {Calcifying marine phytoplankton‚Äîcoccolithophores‚Äî are some of the most successful yet enigmatic organisms in the ocean and are at risk from global change. To better understand how they will be affected, we need to know ‚Äúwhy‚Äù coccolithophores calcify. We review coccolithophorid evolutionary history and cell biology as well as insights from recent experiments to provide a critical assessment of the costs and benefits of calcification. We conclude that calcification has high energy demands and that coccolithophores might have calcified initially to reduce grazing pressure but that additional benefits such as protection from photodamage and viral/bacterial attack further explain their high diversity and broad spectrum ecology. The cost-benefit aspect of these traits is illustrated by novel ecosystem modeling, although conclusive observations remain limited. In the future ocean, the trade-off between changing ecological and physiological costs of calcification and their benefits will ultimately decide how this important group is affected by ocean acidification and global warming.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic phytoplankton have a small global biomass but play major roles in primary production and climate. Despite improved understanding of phytoplankton diversity and evolution, we largely ignore the cellular bases of their environmental plasticity. By comparative 3D morphometric analysis across seven distant phytoplankton taxa, we observe constant volume occupancy by the main organelles and preserved volumetric ratios between plastids and mitochondria. We hypothesise that phytoplankton subcellular topology is modulated by energy-management constraints. Consistent with this, shifting the diatom Phaeodactylum from low to high light enhances photosynthesis and respiration, increases cell-volume occupancy by mitochondria and the plastid CO2-fixing pyrenoid, and boosts plastid-mitochondria contacts. Changes in organelle architectures and interactions also accompany Nannochloropsis acclimation to different trophic lifestyles, along with respiratory and photosynthetic responses. By revealing evolutionarily-conserved topologies of energy-managing organelles, and their role in phytoplankton acclimation, this work deciphers phytoplankton responses at subcellular scales.},

Oxic respiration is by far the most important pathway of organic carbon in deep-sea sediments and significantly determines the recycling of organic matter introduced onto the sediment surface. Even if some uncertainty remains, benthic oxygen fluxes reveal probably a reasonable approximation to the total carbon oxidation rate under deep-marine conditions. However, benthic fluxes vary considerably in the various ocean basins and the interactions between all parameters controlling benthic biogeochemical activities are not yet completely understood. Above, we showed some examples in which benthic activity deviates from the generally expected situation as suggested by export fluxes from the surface waters. We further elaborate these concepts in Chapter 12 where we summarize existent approaches for the regionalization of benthic fluxes and present methods how to access mineralization processes in surface sediments of the deep-sea globally and arrive at a definition of benthic biogeochemical provinces.},

Crossing the threshold would lead to a much higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene. We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System‚Äîbiosphere, climate, and societies‚Äîand could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.},

This was likely due to the silicate weathering-negative feedback and the expansion of land plants that together ensured Earth‚Äôs long-term habitability. Humanity‚Äôs fossil-fuel use, if unabated, risks taking us, by the middle of the twenty-first century, to values of CO2 not seen since the early Eocene (50 million years ago).

For our established cracker system, we found an analytical artifact, which increases over the deepest 200 m and reaches 10.1 ¬± 2.4 ppm in the oldest/deepest part. The governing mechanism is not yet fully understood, but it is related to insufficient gas extraction in combination with ice relaxation during storage and ice structure. The corrected record presented here resolves partly - but not completely - the issue with a different correlation between CO2 and Antarctic temperatures found in this oldest part of the records.

In this Review, we outline tectonic, magmatic and hydrothermal processes that govern crustal architecture, alteration and biogeochemical cycles along mid-ocean ridges with different spreading rates. In general, hydrothermal systems vary from those that are magmatic-dominated with low-pH fluids {\textgreater}300‚Äâ¬∞C to serpentinizing systems with alkaline fluids {\textless}120‚Äâ¬∞C. Typically, slow-spreading ridges (rates {\textless}40‚Äâmm‚Äâyr‚àí1) have greater variability in magmatism, lithology and vent chemistry, which are influenced by detachment faults that expose lower-crustal and serpentinized mantle rocks. Hydrothermal alteration is an important sink for magnesium, sodium, sulfate and bicarbonate, and a net source of volatiles, iron and other nutrients to the deep ocean and vent ecosystems. Magmatic hydrothermal systems sustain a vast, hot and diverse microbial biosphere that represents a deep organic carbon source to ocean carbon budgets. In contrast, high-pH serpentinizing hydrothermal systems harbour a more limited microbial community consisting primarily of methane-metabolizing archaea. Continued advances in monitoring and analytical capabilities coupled with developments in metagenomic technologies will guide future investigations and discoveries in hydrothermal systems.},

	abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been extraordinarily successful in the task of knowledge synthesis and risk assessment. However, the strong scientific consensus on the detection, attribution, and risks of climate change stands in stark contrast to widespread confusion, complacency and denial among policymakers and the public. Risk communication is now a major bottleneck preventing science from playing an appropriate role in climate policy. Here I argue that the ability of the IPCC to fulfill its mission can be enhanced through better understanding of the mental models of the audiences it seeks to reach, then altering the presentation and communication of results accordingly. Few policymakers are trained in science, and public understanding of basic facts about climate change is poor. But the problem is deeper. Our mental models lead to persistent errors and biases in complex dynamic systems like the climate and economy. Where the consequences of our actions spill out across space and time, our mental models have narrow boundaries and focus on the short term. Where the dynamics of complex systems are conditioned by multiple feedbacks, time delays, accumulations and nonlinearities, we have difficulty recognizing and understanding feedback processes, underestimate time delays, and do not understand basic principles of accumulation or how nonlinearities can create regime shifts. These problems arise not only among laypeople but also among highly educated elites with significant training in science. They arise not only in complex systems like the climate but also in familiar contexts such as filling a bathtub. Therefore they cannot be remedied merely by providing more information about the climate, but require different modes of communication, including experiential learning environments such as interactive simulations.},
